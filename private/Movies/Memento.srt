1
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,650
<i>So where are you?
You're in some motel room.</i>

2
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,860
<i>You just wake up,
and you're in a motel room.</i>

3
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,280
<i>There's the key. It feels like maybe it's
just the first time you've been there...</i>

4
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,950
<i>but... perhaps you've
been there for a week...</i>

5
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,580
<i>three months.</i>

6
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,870
<i>It's kind of hard to say.
I don't know.</i>

7
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,410
<i>It's just an anonymous room.</i>

8
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,580
This guy.

9
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,920
He's here already.

10
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,010
Lenny!

11
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,470
It's Leonard...

12
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,220
like I told you before.

13
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,300
Did you? I must have forgot.

14
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,180
I guess I've already
told you about my condition.

15
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,350
Only every time I see you.

16
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,990
- My car.
- This <i>is</i> your car.

17
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,120
You're in a playful mood.

18
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,490
It's not good to make fun
of someone's handicap.

19
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,330
Just trying to have a little fun.

20
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Roll up your window.

21
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,850
- It's broken.
- I can get that fixed for you.

22
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,890
- So where to, Sherlock?
- I got a lead on a place.

23
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,900
What the hell you wanna go there for?

24
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,360
- You know it?
- Yeah. It's just this fucked-up building.

25
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,730
- Why do you wanna go there?
- Don't remember.

26
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,590
- Looks like somebody's home.
- That thing's been here for years.

27
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,890
What are you talking about?
These tracks are only a few days old.

28
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,640
Tracks? What are you? Pocahontas?

29
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,690
Come on!

30
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,530
Let's take a look inside.

31
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,670
"Teddy."

32
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,680
"Don't believe his lies.
He is the one. Kill him."

33
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,520
I finally found him.
How long have I been looking?

34
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,560
Find anything?

35
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,770
Didn't think so.

36
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,230
Let's go.

37
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,150
Fuck this.

38
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,110
You're gonna pay for what you did.

39
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,240
- Beg forgiveness, and then you pay.
- Leonard.

40
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,370
You don't have a clue, you freak.

41
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,750
Beg my wife's forgiveness
before I blow your brains out.

42
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,800
Leonard, you don't know what's going on.

43
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,340
- You don't even know my name.
- Teddy.

44
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,590
That's 'cause you read it
off a fucking picture.

45
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,970
You don't know who you are.

46
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,680
I'm Leonard Shelby.
I'm from San Francisco.

47
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,600
That's who you were.
That's not what you've become.

48
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,190
- Shut your mouth.
- You want to know, Lenny?

49
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,570
Come on.

50
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,440
Come on.
Let's go down to the basement.

51
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,530
Let's go down, you and me, together.

52
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,610
Then you'll know who you really are.

53
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,120
No!

54
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,670
<i>It's just an anonymous room.</i>

55
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,750
<i>There's nothing in the drawers.
But you look anyway.</i>

56
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,760
<i>Nothing except the Gideon Bible,
which I, of course, read religiously.</i>

57
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,350
<i>You know who you are,
and you know kind of all about yourself.</i>

58
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:47,020
<i>Butjust for day-to-day stuff,
notes are really useful.</i>

59
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,810
<i>SammyJankis had the same problem...</i>

60
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,860
<i>but he really had no system.</i>

61
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,320
<i>He wrote himself
a ridiculous amount of notes...</i>

62
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,320
<i>but he'd get them all mixed up.</i>

63
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,660
<i>You really do need a system
if you're gonna make it work.</i>

64
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,460
- Hi.
- Hi.

65
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,800
- I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
- What can I do for you, Leonard?

66
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:03,760
Burt.

67
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,180
Burt. I'm not sure. I think I may have
asked you to hold my calls.

68
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,100
- You don't know?
- I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.

69
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,850
Right. You said you like to look people
in the eye when you talk to them.

70
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,360
Yeah.

71
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,070
You don't remember saying that?

72
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,400
- That's the thing. I have this condition.
- A condition?

73
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,860
- It's my memory.
- Amnesia?

74
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,740
No, no. It's different from that.
I have no short-term memory.

75
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,790
I know who I am.
I know all about myself.

76
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:32,330
Since my injury, I can't make new memories.
Everything fades.

77
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,630
If we talk for too long,
I'll forget how we started.

78
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,420
Next time I see you,
I'm not gonna remember this conversation.

79
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,090
I don't even know if I've met you before.

80
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,260
So, if I seem a little strange
or rude or something...

81
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,310
I've told you this before, haven't I?

82
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,480
Yeah. I don't mean to mess with you,
but it's so weird.

83
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,770
- You don't remember me at all?
- No.

84
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,690
- We've talked a bunch of times.
- I'm sure we have.

85
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,820
What's the last thing you remember?

86
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,400
My wife.

87
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,280
What's it like?

88
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,460
It's like waking.
It's like you just woke up.

89
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,750
That must suck.

90
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,460
It's all backwards.

91
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,800
Maybe you get an idea what you want to do next,
but you don't remember what you just did.

92
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,720
- I'm exactly the opposite...
- How long have I been staying here?

93
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,850
- Couple of days.
- And you're holding my calls?

94
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,640
- Like you said.
- Okay, but this guy's an exception.

95
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,610
- You know this guy?
- Yeah, it's your friend, right?

96
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,770
What makes you think he's my friend?

97
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,820
- I just saw you together, that's all.
- He's not my friend.

98
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,740
- Okay.
- If he calls or if he shows up here...

99
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,620
give me a call in my room, okay?

100
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,280
His name's Teddy?

101
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,330
- Teddy, yeah.
- All right.

102
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,580
Look, I hope my condition's
not gonna be a problem for you.

103
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,920
No, not as long as
you remember to pay the bill.

104
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,130
Yeah. Okay.

105
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,010
- Forty.
- Forty.

106
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,260
This guy...

107
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,050
He's here already.

108
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,180
Lenny!

109
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,440
<i>You really need a system
if you're gonna make it work.</i>

110
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,560
<i>You kind of learn
to trust your own handwriting.</i>

111
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:24,690
<i>That becomes an important part of
your life. You write yourself notes.</i>

112
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,110
<i>Where you put your notes...
That also becomes important.</i>

113
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,780
<i>You need a jacket that's got
like six pockets in it.</i>

114
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,080
<i>Particular pockets for particular things.</i>

115
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,000
<i>You just kind of learn to know
where things go and how the system works.</i>

116
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,130
<i>And you have to be wary of other people writing
stuff for you that is not gonna make sense...</i>

117
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,170
<i>or is gonna lead you astray.</i>

118
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,550
<i>I don't know. I guess people try and take
advantage of somebody with this condition.</i>

119
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:51,720
<i>If you have a piece
of information which is vital...</i>

120
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,220
<i>writing on your body instead of
on a piece of paper can be the answer.</i>

121
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,600
<i>It's just a permanent
way of keeping a note.</i>

122
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,570
Who is this?

123
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,250
"Remember SammyJankis."

124
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,190
Excuse me, sir.
You left these at your table.

125
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,990
Thanks.

126
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,820
- Lincoln Street?
- Yeah.

127
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,030
Go straight out on Sixth Street.
Go east all the way...

128
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,330
- Hold on. I'm gonna write this down.
- It's easy. Just go...

129
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,370
Trust me. I need to write this down.

130
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,380
"The Discount Inn."

131
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
Discount Inn.

132
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,990
Natalie.

133
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,370
My car.

134
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,170
Teddy.

135
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,010
"John Edward Gammell."

136
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,690
This guy told me his name was Teddy.

137
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,570
"Don't believe his lies."

138
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,000
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Mr. Gammell?

139
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,960
- <i>Lenny, is that you?</i>
- John Gammell?

140
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,460
<i>Lenny, it's Teddy. Stay there.
I'll be right over.</i>

141
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,470
Okay. I'll be waiting.

142
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,860
"White. Male."

143
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,450
"First name John."

144
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,450
"Last name: G" for Gammell.

145
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,130
"Drugs. License plate."

146
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,630
"SG 13...

147
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,550
7I U."

148
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,640
It's him.

149
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,810
I found you, you fuck.

150
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,210
You said we talked before.
I don't remember that.

151
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Yeah, but it's not amnesia.
I remember everything up until my injury.

152
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,590
I just can't make new memories.
So I can't remember talking to you.

153
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,640
What did we talk about?
Oh, Sammy Jankis.

154
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,060
I guess I tell people about Sammy
to help them understand.

155
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,890
Sammy's story helps me
understand my own situation.

156
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:36,110
Sammy wrote himself endless
amounts of notes, but he got mixed up.

157
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,570
I have a more graceful
solution to the memory problem.

158
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,370
I'm disciplined and organized.

159
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,990
I use habit and routine
to make my life possible.

160
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,410
Sammy had no drive,
no reason to make it work.

161
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,090
Me? Yeah, I got a reason.

162
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,360
"Today, 1:00 p.m.
Meet Natalie for info.

163
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,030
She has also lost someone.

164
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,530
She will help you out of pity."

165
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,260
- Natalie?
- You don't remember me.

166
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,260
- Sorry. I should have explained. I have this...
- You did explain, Lenny.

167
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,720
Please call me Leonard.
My wife called me Lenny.

168
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,390
- Yeah, I know. You told me.
- Then I probably told you how much I hated it.

169
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,890
Yeah.

170
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,400
Do you mind taking your glasses off?
It's hard for me to...

171
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,440
Thanks.
So you have information for me?

172
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,280
- Is that what your little note says?
- Yeah.

173
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,240
Must be tough living your life
according to a couple of scraps of paper.

174
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,120
You mix your laundry list
with your grocery list...

175
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,370
and you'll end up
eating your underwear for breakfast.

176
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,210
I guess that's why you have
those freaky tattoos.

177
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,460
Yeah, it's tough.
It's almost impossible.

178
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,510
I'm sorry I don't remember you.
It's nothing personal.

179
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,760
I do have information for you.

180
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,430
You gave me a license plate number.

181
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,730
Had my friend at DMV trace it.

182
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,270
Guess what name came up.

183
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,860
John Edward Gammell. John G.

184
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,570
- Do you know him?
- No.

185
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,740
But his face on his driver's license
looked really familiar.

186
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,820
I think he's been in the bar, maybe.

187
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,910
Here's a copy of his license,
his registration, photo and all.

188
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,500
Are you sure you want this?

189
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,370
- Have I told you what this man did?
- Yeah.

190
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,210
Then you shouldn't have to ask.

191
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,000
But even if you get revenge,
you're not gonna remember it.

192
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,170
You're not even gonna
know that it happened.

193
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,590
My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn't make
any difference whether I know about it.

194
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,930
Just because there are things I don't
remember doesn't make my actions meaningless.

195
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,980
The world doesn'tjust disappear
when you close your eyes, does it?

196
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,690
Anyway, maybe I'll take
a photograph to remind myself...

197
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,940
get another freaky tattoo.

198
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,320
Tell me about her again.

199
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,910
Why?

200
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,910
Because you like to remember her.

201
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,580
She was beautiful.

202
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,210
- To me, she was perfect.
- No. Don't just recite the words.

203
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:51,260
Close your eyes... and remember her.

204
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,940
You can just feel the details.

205
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,650
The bits and pieces
you never bothered to put into words.

206
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,160
And you can feel these extreme moments...

207
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,160
<i>even if you don't want to.</i>

208
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,830
<i>You put these together,
and you get the feel of a person.</i>

209
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,340
Enough to know how much you miss them...

210
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,850
<i>and how much you hate
the person who took them away.</i>

211
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,860
I added an address in here.

212
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,410
It might be useful.
It's an abandoned place outside of town.

213
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,410
A guy I knew used to do bigger deals there.

214
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,540
It's isolated.

215
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,540
Sounds perfect.

216
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,510
- Do I owe you any...
- I wasn't helping you for money.

217
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,800
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

218
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,010
See, you have this condition.

219
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:21,020
Are you still staying at the Discount I nn,
room 304? You left it at my place.

220
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,020
Yeah.

221
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,690
- They treating you okay?
- I don't remember.

222
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,570
You know what we have in common?

223
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,040
We are both survivors.

224
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,460
You take care, Leonard.

225
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,070
"Remember SammyJankis."

226
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,950
I met Sammy through work.
I nsurance. I was an investigator.

227
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,910
I'd investigate the claims
to see which ones were phony.

228
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,080
I had to see through people's bullshit.

229
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,960
It was useful experience,
'cause now it's my life.

230
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,880
When I meet someone,
I don't know if I've met them before.

231
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,880
I have to look in their eyes
and try and figure them out.

232
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,260
<i>My job taught me the best way to find out
what someone knew was just let them talk...</i>

233
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,720
<i>and watch the eyes and the body language.</i>

234
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,390
<i>If someone scratches their nose while they're
talking, experts tell you it means they're lying.</i>

235
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,980
<i>It really means they're nervous. People
get nervous for all sorts of reasons.</i>

236
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,270
<i>It's all about context.</i>

237
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,230
Yeah, I was good.

238
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,320
Sammy was my first real challenge.

239
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,370
Yo, Lenny!
I thought you split for good.

240
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,750
- Things change.
- So I see.

241
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,920
- My name's Teddy.
- I guess I've told you about my condition.

242
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Only every time I see you.
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.

243
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,890
- Have I told you about SammyJankis?
- Yeah.

244
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,520
I'm sick of hearing about the guy. What
about John G.? You think he's still here?

245
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,850
- Who?
- Johnny G., the guy you're looking for.

246
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,520
- That's why you haven't left town, am I right?
- Maybe.

247
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,900
- Leonard, look. You have to be very careful.
- Why?

248
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,400
The other day you mentioned that maybe
somebody was trying to set you up...

249
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,240
get you to kill the wrong guy.

250
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,410
I go on facts, not recommendations,
but thank you.

251
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,540
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life
to your little notes and pictures.

252
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,420
- Why not?
- Because your notes could be unreliable.

253
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,170
- Memory's unreliable.
- Oh, please!

254
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,590
No, really. Memory's not perfect.
It's not even that good.

255
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:58,210
Ask the police.
Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

256
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,260
The cops don't catch a killer
by sitting around remembering stuff.

257
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,140
They collect facts, they make notes,
and they draw conclusions.

258
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,260
Facts, not memories.

259
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,810
That's how you investigate.
I know. It's what I used to do.

260
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:13,100
Memory can change the shape of a room.
It can change the color of a car.

261
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,270
And memories can be distorted.

262
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,530
They're just an interpretation.
They're not a record.

263
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,690
They're irrelevant if you have the facts.

264
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,490
You really want to get this guy,
don't you?

265
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,370
He killed my wife.
He took away my fucking memory.

266
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,290
He destroyed my ability to live.

267
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,210
You're living.

268
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,010
Only for revenge.

269
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,920
Then we'll get the bastard.
Where you staying?

270
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,470
The Discount Inn.

271
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,020
I don't know what room.
I haven't got my key.

272
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,930
Probably left it in your room.

273
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,490
H i. I'm checked in here,
but I think I've misplaced my key.

274
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,830
How you doing, Leonard?
Probably in the room, right?

275
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,100
- Don't see my key anywhere.
- Shit.

276
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,270
This is the wrong room.
You're in 304 now.

277
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,360
- I'm sorry. I fucked up.
- This is not my room?

278
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,940
No. Let's go.

279
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,030
Why is this my handwriting?

280
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,990
This was your room,
but now you're in 304.

281
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,330
- When was I in here?
- Last week.

282
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,870
But then I rented you
another room on top of it.

283
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,080
- Why?
- Business is slow.

284
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:00,040
I told my boss
about your condition and stuff...

285
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,340
and he said,
"Try and rent him another room."

286
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,470
How many rooms am I checked
into in this shit-hole?

287
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,010
J ust two, so far.

288
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,760
At least you're being honest
about ripping me off.

289
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,390
You're not gonna remember anyway.

290
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,390
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

291
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,110
Leonard, always get a receipt.

292
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,400
Yeah. I'm gonna write that down.

293
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,950
- What time is it?
- Quarter to 1:00.

294
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,700
Your room's...

295
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,550
- Natalie?
- You don't remember me.

296
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,800
I'd just become an investigator
when I came across Sammy.

297
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,600
M r. Samuel R. Jankis.
Strangest case ever.

298
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,480
You know, the guy's a 58-year-old
semiretired accountant.

299
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,230
He and his wife had been in this
car accident. Nothing too serious.

300
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,520
<i>But he's acting funny.
He can't get a handle on what's going on.</i>

301
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,780
<i>The doctors find some possible damage
to the hippocampus.</i>

302
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:10,410
<i>Nothing conclusive, but Sammy can't remember
anything for more than a couple of minutes.</i>

303
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,240
<i>Can't work, can't do shit.
The medical bills pile up.</i>

304
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,040
<i>His wife calls the insurance company,
and I get sent in.</i>

305
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,000
<i>Now, this is my first big claims
investigation, so I really check into it.</i>

306
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:26,300
<i>Sammy can thinkjust fine,
but he can't make any new memories.</i>

307
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,720
<i>He could only remember things
for a couple of minutes.</i>

308
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,510
- This is M r. Shelby.
- <i>He'd watch TV...</i>

309
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,930
<i>but anything longer than
a couple of minutes was too confusing.</i>

310
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,850
<i>He couldn't remember how it began.
He liked commercials. They were short.</i>

311
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,020
Sammy. It's time for my shot.

312
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,980
<i>The crazy part was that this guy...</i>

313
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,270
<i>who couldn't even follow the plot
of</i> Green Acres <i>anymore...</i>

314
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,440
<i>could do the most complicated things...</i>

315
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,910
<i>as long as he learned them
before the accident...</i>

316
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,490
<i>and as long as he kept his mind
on what he was doing.</i>

317
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,330
Be gentle.

318
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:00,710
<i>The doctors assure me there's a real
condition called anterograde memory loss...</i>

319
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,750
<i>or short-term memory loss.</i>

320
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,840
<i>It's rare, but legit.</i>

321
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,590
<i>But every time I see him...</i>

322
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,340
<i>I catch this look...</i>

323
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:15,010
<i>this slight look of recognition.</i>

324
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,930
<i>But he says he can't remember me at all.</i>

325
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,140
Sammy, it's okay. I got it. I got it.

326
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,060
- Hi, Mr. Shelby.
- Hi, M rs. Jankis.

327
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:27,110
<i>I can read people,
and I'm thinking: Bad actor.</i>

328
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,700
So now I'm suspicious,
and I order more tests.

329
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,280
Awake.

330
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,000
Where am I?

331
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,630
Somebody's bedroom.

332
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,300
It must be her room.

333
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,420
But who is she?

334
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,640
It's only me.

335
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,860
- Did you sleep okay?
- Yeah. You?

336
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:12,320
Oh, shit. I gotta be someplace.

337
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,830
- It's pretty weird.
- It's useful.

338
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,830
You never write a phone
number on your hand?

339
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,380
I should be able to talk to my friend
today about the license plate.

340
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,300
- Yeah, the license plate.
- John G.'s license plate.

341
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,430
You have it tattooed on your thigh.

342
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,280
"Natalie."

343
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,870
"She has also lost someone.

344
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,870
She will help you out of pity."

345
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,050
If it's registered in this state...

346
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,130
it should only take a couple seconds
to pull up his license and registration.

347
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,010
I'll call you as soon as I talk to him.

348
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:20,100
Do you think we could just arrange a meeting
now? I'm not too good on the phone.

349
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,690
It's great that you...

350
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:36,280
that you're helping me like this.

351
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,870
I'm helping you because you helped me.

352
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,840
So next time you see me,
will you remember me?

353
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,860
I think you will.

354
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,320
I'm sorry.

355
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,290
Lenny, before you go,
could I have my shirt back, please?

356
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:43,510
Yo, Lenny!
I thought you split for good.

357
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,970
Sammy couldn't pick up
any new skills at all.

358
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:50,390
But I find something
in my research: Conditioning.

359
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,480
Sammy should still be able to learn
through repetition.

360
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,980
It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike.
You just get better through practice.

361
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,570
It's a completely different part of
the brain from the short-term memory.

362
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,740
So I had the doctors test
Sammy's response to conditioning.

363
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,990
Just pick up any three objects.

364
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,240
That's a test?

365
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,910
Where were you guys when I did my CPA?

366
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,170
Sorry.

367
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,960
Ow! What the fuck?

368
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:21,260
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack.

369
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,760
<i>Some of the objects were electrified.</i>

370
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,220
<i>They'd give him a small shock.
They kept repeating the test...</i>

371
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,270
always with the same objects electrified.

372
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,940
The point was to see if Sammy could learn
to avoid the electrified objects...

373
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,020
not by memory, but by instinct.

374
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,710
Natalie, right?
Who the fuck is Dodd?

375
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,430
- Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
- What the fuck have you got me into?

376
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,010
Come inside.

377
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,190
- Who is he?
- Calm down. Okay?

378
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,770
This is my problem. You offered to help. It
has nothing to do with your investigation.

379
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,360
How did you get me into this?

380
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,480
You offered to help when you saw
what he did to my face.

381
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:24,150
- How do I know he did that to your face?
- Because I came straight to you after he did it.

382
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,490
I showed you what he did,
and I asked you to help me.

383
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,530
- And I just take your word?
- Yeah.

384
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,910
Something doesn't feel right.

385
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,540
I think someone's fucking with me,
trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.

386
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,040
- Did you?
- What?

387
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,540
- Kill him?
- Of course not!

388
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,670
Hey.

389
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,590
Sit down, okay? Sit.

390
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,510
This has nothing to do with you.

391
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,970
You helped me out, and I'm grateful.

392
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,760
You have to burn them.

393
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,350
Leonard, you decided to help me.
Trust yourself.

394
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,440
Trust your own judgment.
You can question everything.

395
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,280
- You can never know anything for sure.
- There are things you know for sure.

396
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,490
Such as?

397
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,780
I know what that's gonna sound like
when I knock on it.

398
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,870
I know what that's gonna
feel like when I pick it up.

399
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:14,620
See? Certainties. It's the kind
of memory you take for granted.

400
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,630
You know, I can remember so much.

401
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,920
The feel of the world... and her.

402
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,350
She's gone.

403
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:36,390
And the present is trivia,
which I scribble down as fucking notes!

404
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,400
Hey. Come on.
Try and relax. Come on.

405
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,820
It's not easy for me to relax,
you know?

406
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,570
Come on. Take yourjacket off.

407
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,200
Now. Come on.

408
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,740
Hey.

409
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,620
Didn't think you were the type.

410
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,670
It's backwards.

411
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,420
Come here.

412
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,180
Come here.

413
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,120
What about here?

414
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,870
Maybe it's for when I find him.

415
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,040
I've lost somebody too.

416
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,460
I'm sorry.

417
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,760
His name was Jimmy.

418
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,880
- What happened to him?
- He went to meet somebody.

419
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,930
He never came back.

420
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:55,680
- Who did he go to meet?
- A guy called Teddy.

421
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
What do the police think?

422
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,940
They don't look too hard
for guys like Jimmy.

423
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,570
When you find this guy, this John G...

424
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,610
what are you gonna do?

425
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,280
I'm gonna kill him.

426
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,870
Maybe I can help you find him.

427
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,380
I don't even know how long she's been gone.

428
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,760
It's like I've woken up in bed
and she's not here...

429
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,640
because she's gone to
the bathroom or something.

430
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,690
But somehow I just...

431
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,730
I just know she's never
gonna come back to bed.

432
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,790
If I could just reach over
and touch her side of the bed...

433
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,580
I would know that it was cold.

434
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,710
But I can't.

435
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,640
I know I can't have her back.

436
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:20,350
But I don't want to wake up
in the morning thinking she's still here.

437
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:26,270
I lie here not knowing
how long I've been alone.

438
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,120
How can I heal?

439
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:44,670
How am I supposed to heal
if I can't... feel time?

440
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,990
"She has also lost someone.

441
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,530
She will help you out of pity."

442
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,810
They kept testing Sammy for months...

443
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,690
always with the same objects
carrying the electrical charge.

444
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,530
Ow! What the fuck?

445
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,030
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack!

446
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,820
Even with total short-term memory loss...

447
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,660
<i>Sammy should have learned to instinctively
stop picking up the wrong objects.</i>

448
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,790
<i>All the previous cases responded to
conditioning. Sammy didn't respond at all.</i>

449
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:51,460
<i>It was enough to suggest that his condition
was psychological, not physical.</i>

450
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:55,000
We turned down his claim on the grounds
that he wasn't covered for mental illness.

451
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,800
His wife got stuck with the bills,
and I got a big promotion.

452
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,180
Conditioning didn't work for Sammy,
so he became helpless.

453
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,180
But it works for me.

454
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,640
I live the way Sammy couldn't.

455
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,140
Habit and routine make my life possible.

456
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:14,150
Conditioning. Acting on instinct.

457
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,160
Awake.

458
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,410
Where am I?

459
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,620
Motel room.

460
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,760
Some anonymous motel room.

461
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,680
Nothing in the drawers,
but I'll take a look anyway.

462
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:50,230
Nothing except the Gideon Bible.

463
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,450
Lenny! Open up!

464
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,250
Just a minute.

465
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,870
Open the door.

466
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,210
Lenny.

467
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,960
Open the door.

468
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,970
Come on!

469
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,560
Hi, Teddy.

470
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,890
Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?

471
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,160
I get it.

472
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,700
Amorous neighbors.

473
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,240
What are you doing here?

474
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,040
You called me.
You said you needed my help.

475
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,670
I've had more rewarding
friendships than this one.

476
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:59,090
Although I do get to keep
telling the same jokes.

477
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,840
What the fuck is that?

478
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,350
- Who the fuck is that?
- You don't know him?

479
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,060
No! Should I?

480
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,770
Wait a minute.

481
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,310
- Is thatJohn G.?
- I don't think so.

482
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,690
- You don't think so? You didn't write it down?
- I might've fallen asleep before I did.

483
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,770
For Christ's sakes!

484
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,610
Ask him.

485
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,240
What's your name?

486
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,330
Your name.

487
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,740
- Dodd.
- Who did this to you?

488
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,410
- What?
- Who did this to you?

489
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,000
You did.

490
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,510
- I'm not gonna help you kill that guy.
- No, just let me think for a minute.

491
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,720
Okay, Natalie. Who's Natalie?

492
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,270
- Natalie who?
- Why?

493
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:56,440
- Maybe I know her.
- Look. We gotta get him out of here.

494
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,980
All right, all right.

495
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,070
He's gotta have a car, right?

496
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:05,740
We take him down to his car, tell him to get
the fuck out of town or we're gonna kill him.

497
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,900
We can't walk him out of here
tied up and bleeding.

498
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:10,450
- How the fuck did you get him up here?
- I don't know.

499
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,490
You don't know.

500
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,580
Yes, I do. This is not my room.

501
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,460
It must be his room.
Great! Let's go.

502
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,500
- No, no. We can't just leave him here.
- Why not?

503
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:25,130
Because the maid's gonna walk in. She'll
see him, call the cops. He can ID us.

504
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:28,840
Okay. We untie him...

505
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:31,800
we clean him up, and we march him
out of here with a gun in his back.

506
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,850
A gun. Why would I have a gun?

507
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:38,690
It must be his. I don't think
they'd let someone like me carry a gun.

508
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:41,520
Fucking hope not.

509
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,360
Which one?

510
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,910
We should probably steal his car.
You know, teach him a lesson.

511
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,950
Shut up.

512
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,460
That's all right for you to say.
You're the one with the Jag.

513
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,420
Get in.
I'm gonna ride with him. You follow us.

514
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,420
Give me your keys.

515
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,710
Take your own car.

516
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:37,700
- So was he scared?
- Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache.

517
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:40,500
Fuck you.
You should have stolen his car.

518
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,630
- Why? What's wrong with this one?
- Nothing. You want to trade?

519
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,050
So what do you do now?

520
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,590
I'm going to find out
what the fuck that was all about.

521
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,600
Natalie, right?
Who the fuck is Dodd?

522
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:07,270
Sammy's wife was crippled
by the cost of supporting him...

523
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,440
and fighting the company's decision.

524
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,610
But it wasn't the money that got to her.

525
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,700
- <i>I never said that Sammy was faking.</i>
- Listen. I have an idea.

526
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,410
Sammy, I have an idea.

527
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:21,160
<i>Just that his problem was mental,
not physical.</i>

528
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:24,500
I want you to have a pen
in your pocket, okay?

529
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,130
- <i>But she couldn't understand.</i>
- You're gonna have a pad in your pocket.

530
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:29,210
- I did something wrong?
- You did something wrong!

531
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,420
We're gonna deal with it.
We're gonna try harder.

532
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,630
<i>She looks into his eyes
and sees the same person.</i>

533
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,850
<i>If it's not a physical problem,
he should just snap out of it.</i>

534
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:39,640
- Ellen called!
- Ellen called?

535
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:44,350
- Ellen can't come today! Ellen can't come!
- Okay. I'm sorry!

536
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,560
- I'm sorry. I'm trying. I'm sorry.
- Try harder!

537
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:55,450
So good old Leonard Shelby from the insurance
company gives her the seed of doubt...

538
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:58,160
just like he gave it to the doctors.

539
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:01,660
But I never said that he was faking.
I never said that.

540
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,380
I don't feel drunk.

541
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,080
- Hello?
- Shit.

542
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,580
Housekeeping.

543
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,750
- Not right now.
- I'm sorry.

544
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:51,940
Okay.

545
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:00,780
"Dodd. Put him onto Teddy
or just get rid of him for Natalie."

546
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:07,950
Dodd.

547
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:16,500
Get rid of him. Ask Natalie.

548
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,010
Teddy, Teddy.

549
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,690
<i>Leave your number.
You know what to do.</i>

550
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:35,940
Yeah. This is a message for Teddy.

551
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:38,070
I'm at the Mountcrest Inn
of Fifth Street, room six.

552
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:41,150
I need you to come over
as soon as you get this. It's important.

553
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,490
This is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.

554
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,290
Fuck.

555
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:02,340
What Mrs. Jankis didn't understand was that
you can't bully someone into remembering.

556
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,430
The more pressure you're under,
the harder it gets.

557
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,180
Then call me back?

558
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,910
Okay. What am I doing?

559
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,880
I'm chasing this guy.

560
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,130
No. He's chasing me.

561
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:06,570
Fuck.

562
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:12,290
"Dodd. White guy.

563
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:14,330
Mountcrest Inn on Fifth Street."

564
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:17,960
I'll get the jump on you, you fucker.

565
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,960
Fuck.

566
00:50:58,630 --> 00:50:59,960
Sorry.

567
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,500
I need a weapon.

568
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:39,920
This'll do.

569
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:06,070
I don't feel drunk.

570
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:49,740
Do I know this guy?

571
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,740
He seems to know me.

572
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,000
What the fuck?

573
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,760
- I like your car.
- Thank you.

574
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:16,850
- Where'd you get it?
- Are you interested in buying one?

575
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,390
I haven't made a strong enough
impression on you?

576
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,480
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

577
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,110
Okay. What am I doing?

578
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:46,500
Who is this?

579
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,040
Ouch. Cut it out.

580
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:41,990
- How can you read that again?
- It's good.

581
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,120
Yeah, but you've read it,
like, a thousand times.

582
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,790
I enjoy it.

583
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,790
I always thought the pleasure of a book
was in wanting to know what happens next.

584
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,590
Don't be a prick.

585
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:55,250
I'm not reading it to annoy you.
I enjoy it.

586
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,880
Just let me read, please.

587
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:12,100
Probably tried this before.

588
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:17,070
Probably burned truckloads of your stuff.

589
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,610
Can't remember to forget you.

590
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:41,010
Yeah.

591
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:42,800
Uh-huh.

592
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,770
Sir, that'd certainly be in keeping
with some of my own discoveries.

593
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:51,730
I was hoping for a little more on the
drugs angle. Can you hang on a sec?

594
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,570
The police report mentioned the drugs
found in the car outside my house.

595
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,740
The car was stolen,
but his prints were all over it.

596
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:08,540
I got friends in the department.
They gave me a copy of it.

597
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,910
I dealt with the police a lot
in my insurance job.

598
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,080
With my condition, it's really tough.
I can't keep it all in mind at once.

599
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:18,420
I have to summarize the different sections.
And there's pages missing.

600
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,670
I guess I've been trying to log them all.

601
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,010
I don't know why these are crossed out.

602
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:25,010
But they weren't even looking for John G.

603
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,850
The stuff they found in the car fit in with
what they believed had happened...

604
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:29,850
so they didn't chase any of it up.

605
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:07,050
Honey.

606
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,350
Honey, it's late.

607
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,500
Everything okay?

608
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,600
You okay in there?

609
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,810
Was it good for you?

610
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:04,940
What?
Was I supposed to lock the door?

611
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:06,950
No.

612
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:11,280
I'd like you to leave now.

613
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:35,350
There's something about the drugs stashed
in the car that doesn't ring true for me.

614
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,940
Because the police claim
the guy was an addict...

615
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,020
needing money to score,
which I think is bullshit...

616
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:43,360
'cause he's not gonna go breaking into places
while he's still got a stash that big.

617
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,990
I think John G. left it there
or planted it there.

618
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,820
How do you know that?

619
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,290
Shit. That's true. It fits.

620
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,950
So he's a dealer.

621
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:59,540
Hang on a sec.

622
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,680
Now we're getting somewhere.

623
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,350
"Discount Inn."

624
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,530
Yeah, okay. Blonde's fine.

625
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:14,030
That's what they say.

626
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,240
The Discount Inn. 304.

627
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,290
Leonard.

628
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,120
What then?

629
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:24,420
We just go to bed.
You wait for me to fall asleep.

630
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,590
You go into the bathroom
and you slam the door.

631
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:29,210
- Slam it?
- Yeah. Loud enough to wake me up.

632
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,260
- And that's it?
- That's it.

633
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:37,100
First I just need you to put
these things around the room.

634
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:43,270
Just pretend they're your things
and that this is your bedroom.

635
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:59,950
- Should I wear it?
- No. Just like you took it off or something.

636
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:05,330
I don't want you to use it.
I'm sorry.

637
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,130
I just mean put them
around the room...

638
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:11,800
as if they were your things.

639
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,300
Whatever gets you off.

640
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,830
I can't blame the cops
for not taking me seriously.

641
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:47,250
This is a difficult condition
for people to understand.

642
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:50,590
Look at SammyJankis.
His own wife couldn't deal with it.

643
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:53,210
I told you about how she tried
to get him to snap out of it.

644
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:56,630
Eventually she came to see me at the
office. I found out all kinds of shit.

645
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,600
<i>She told me about life with Sammy,
how she treated him.</i>

646
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,140
Thank you for seeing me.

647
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:03,970
It got to the point where she'd get Sammy
to hide food all around the house.

648
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:05,810
Then she'd stop feeding him
to see if his hunger...

649
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:07,850
would make him remember
where he'd hidden the food.

650
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:12,820
<i>She wasn't a cruel person.
She just wanted old Sammy back.</i>

651
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,700
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy
and you've decided that he's faking.

652
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:19,410
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position
isn't that Sammy is faking anything...

653
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:21,410
just that his condition
can't be shown to be...

654
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:24,950
I just want to know
what your honest opinion about Sammy is.

655
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,960
We shouldn't even be talking like this
while the case is still open to appeal.

656
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:31,290
- I'm not appealing the decision.
- Then why are you here?

657
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,840
Try to understand.
When I look at Sammy...

658
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,380
I don't see some... vegetable.

659
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:39,550
I see my same old Sammy.

660
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:46,140
What do you think that's like for me to suspect
he might be imagining this whole problem...

661
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:48,310
and that if I just could
say the right thing...

662
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,190
he'd snap out of it
and go back to being normal?

663
01:03:56,740 --> 01:04:00,530
If I knew that my old
Sammy were truly gone...

664
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:04,740
then I could say good-bye
and start loving this new Sammy.

665
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,580
As long as I have doubt,
I can't say good-bye and move on.

666
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:11,420
What do you want from me?

667
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,670
I want you to forget the company
you work for for 30 seconds...

668
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:18,420
and tell me if you really believe
that Sammy's faking his condition.

669
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:23,680
I need to know...
what you honestly believe.

670
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:32,600
I believe that Sammy should be physically
capable of making new memories.

671
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:41,610
Thank you.

672
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,200
I thought I helped her. I thought
she just needed some kind of answer.

673
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:49,290
I didn't think it was important
what the answer was...

674
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,120
just that she had one to believe.

675
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:10,060
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

676
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,480
- Teddy, your buddy.
- Prove it.

677
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:16,190
Sammy. Remember Sammy?
You told me about Sammy!

678
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:19,230
Geez!

679
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,240
What the fuck are you doing in my car?

680
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,450
What, your sense of humor
went with the memory?

681
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:26,490
- Do you even know why you're here?
- Unfinished business.

682
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:28,950
Lenny, let me inform you.

683
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,410
Your business here is very much finished.

684
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,500
- You're still here because of Natalie.
- Who's Natalie?

685
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:37,710
Schmuck, whose house do you think
you just walked out of?

686
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:43,510
That's right. Take a look at your pictures.
I bet you got one of her.

687
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:47,720
Nice shot, Leibovitz.

688
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:51,560
You'll wanna make a note.
You can't trust her.

689
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,020
Yeah? Why's that?

690
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:56,360
Because by now she's taken
a look at this suit and the car...

691
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,820
and she's starting to figure out ways
of turning the situation to her advantage.

692
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:04,240
She's already got you staying
with her, for Christ's sakes.

693
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:07,910
You can't go back in there.
Let me give you the name of a motel.

694
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:11,870
- You're lucky I ran into you. That broad's bad news.
- What do you mean, "bad news"?

695
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,250
She's involved with drugs.

696
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:16,630
Look. These. You see these?

697
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:18,670
This is the bar where she works.

698
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:20,800
Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.

699
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,510
She takes orders for him,
arranges meets.

700
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:26,470
He writes messages on the back of these.

701
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:29,100
Then she slips him the answers
when she serves him his drinks.

702
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:33,270
- Why should I care?
- Because when she gets jammed up...

703
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:35,520
she's gonna use you to protect herself.

704
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,810
From who?

705
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:39,650
Guys are gonna wanna know
what happened to her boyfriend.

706
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:43,280
Guys are gonna come after her.
Somebody's gotta pay, Lenny.

707
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:46,410
Somebody always pays.
Maybe she'll make it you.

708
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:49,990
Oh, yeah?
Maybe she'll make it you. Is that it?

709
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,990
You worried that she's gonna use me
against you?

710
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,080
- No.
- Why not?

711
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:57,420
Because she doesn't know who I am.

712
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:00,960
- Why are you following me?
- Maybe I wanna help.

713
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:04,970
She doesn't know anything about
your investigation, okay, Einstein?

714
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:07,720
So write this down.

715
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:12,470
When she offers to help,
it'll be for her own reasons.

716
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:17,350
I'm not lying.
Take my pen. Write this down.

717
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,610
Do not trust her.

718
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:30,530
- There. You happy now?
- I won't be happy until you leave town.

719
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:32,530
Why not?

720
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:36,120
You ever wonder how long you can hang around
here before people start asking questions?

721
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:37,290
What sort of questions?

722
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:39,500
The same sort of questions
you should be asking yourself.

723
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:42,130
- Like what?
- Like, how did you get this suit, the car?

724
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:43,840
- I have money.
- From what?

725
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,300
My wife's death. I used to work in
insurance. We were well covered.

726
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:53,140
So in your griefyou wandered
into a Jaguar dealership.

727
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,640
You don't have a clue, do you?

728
01:07:57,730 --> 01:08:00,270
- You don't even know who you are.
- Yes, I do.

729
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:04,110
I don't have amnesia. I remember
everything right up until the incident.

730
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:05,980
I am Leonard Shelby.
I am from San Francisco...

731
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:10,700
That's who you were.
You do not know who you are...

732
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:14,700
what you've become since...
the incident.

733
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:17,330
You wander around playing detective.

734
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:20,000
You don't even know how long ago it was.

735
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:25,800
Let me put it this way. Were you wearing
designer suits when you sold insurance?

736
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,680
- I didn't sell insurance. I investigated it.
- Right. You're an investigator.

737
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:35,220
- Maybe you should start investigating yourself.
- Thank you for the advice.

738
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:40,020
Look, do me a favor.
Don't go back in there.

739
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:42,810
Will you take the motel out of town?

740
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,360
It's been fun, Lenny.

741
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:57,330
"Do not trust her."

742
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,120
"Don't believe his lies."

743
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:16,260
Fuck it. I need my own place.

744
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:27,150
No. She shouldn't have
given me that responsibility.

745
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:29,900
I'm a claims investigator,
not a doctor.

746
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,530
Yeah. I guess.

747
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:35,990
But I've got all sorts
of other considerations.

748
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:39,290
Legal responsibility, large financial...

749
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,750
Who is this?

750
01:09:57,510 --> 01:10:00,220
Write this down.
Write down what happened. Write it down.

751
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:02,640
Concentrate.
Keep it in mind. Find a pen.

752
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,400
What happened?

753
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:12,530
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.

754
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:13,990
Who?

755
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:15,820
Who?

756
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:17,950
Fuck, Leonard. Dodd.
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

757
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:19,950
- Why?
- Why? Because of you.

758
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,750
Because I did what you told me to do!
Go in and reason with him!

759
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:26,370
- Tell him about Teddy! Great fucking idea!
- Calm down. Take it easy.

760
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,290
You're safe. It's okay.

761
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,170
Come on. Just sit down.

762
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:34,170
Sit down.

763
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:36,180
Here. Sit down.

764
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:39,100
Okay. You're okay.

765
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:41,470
I'll just get some ice for your face.

766
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:50,400
Here.

767
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:59,240
I did exactly what you told me to do.

768
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:02,490
I went to Dodd...

769
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:07,000
and I told him that I didn't have any
of Jimmy's money...

770
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,540
or the drugs...

771
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:14,340
and that this Teddy
must have taken everything.

772
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:16,050
And what did he say?

773
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:19,050
He didn't believe me.

774
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,640
He said if I don't have the drugs
by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.

775
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:27,190
Then he just started hitting me.

776
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:31,820
Where is he?

777
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:34,820
- Why?
- I'll go see him.

778
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:35,900
And?

779
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:39,200
I'll give him some bruises of his own and
tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

780
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:41,700
He'll kill you, Lenny.

781
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:45,620
My wife used to call me Lenny.

782
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:47,120
Yeah?

783
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:50,790
Yeah. I hated it.

784
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:54,380
This guy is so dangerous.

785
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:58,010
- Let's just think of something else, okay?
- No, no.

786
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:02,140
You just tell me what he looks like...
and where I can find him.

787
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:05,770
- Have you got a pen?
- In my purse.

788
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:17,690
He'll probably find you.

789
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:21,110
- What do you mean?
- I told him about your car.

790
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:22,910
Why?

791
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:28,250
He was beating the shit out of me.
I had to tell him something.

792
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:31,080
Just write it all down.

793
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:47,470
Be careful.

794
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,480
I'll be fine.

795
01:12:57,570 --> 01:13:00,610
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

796
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:17,960
Front desk?

797
01:13:18,050 --> 01:13:20,630
Burt. Right.
This is Mr. Shelby in room 21.

798
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:23,800
Yeah, that's the thing.
I don't want any calls.

799
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:25,970
Nope. None at all.

800
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,860
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

801
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:40,900
- Who?
- He calls himself Dodd.

802
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:42,400
What does he want?

803
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:45,450
He wants to know what happened to Jimmy
and his money. He thinks I took it.

804
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:46,660
Did you?

805
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:49,040
No.

806
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,000
- What's this all about?
- Fuck!

807
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:58,960
You don't have a fucking clue, do you?
You're just blissfully ignorant, aren't ya?

808
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:02,590
- I have this condition.
- I know all about your fucking condition, Leonard!

809
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:06,090
Probably know more about it than you do. You
don't have a fucking clue about anything else.

810
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,260
What happened?

811
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:10,180
What happened is thatJimmy
went to meet some guy named Teddy.

812
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:12,980
He took a lot of money with him,
and he never came back.

813
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:16,650
Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't
know if you know this Teddy, or how well.

814
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:18,400
- Neither do I.
- Don't protect him!

815
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,520
- I'm not.
- Help me.

816
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:20,860
How?

817
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:23,110
Get rid of Dodd for me.

818
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,240
- What?
- Kill him. I'll pay you.

819
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:28,370
What do you think I am?
I'm not gonna kill someone for money.

820
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:30,490
What then? Love?

821
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:32,290
What would you kill for?

822
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:34,960
- You'd kill for your wife, wouldn't you?
- That's different.

823
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,540
- Not to me. I wasn't fucking married to her.
- Hey, don't talk about my wife.

824
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:40,880
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!

825
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,420
I can say whatever I want
and you won't remember.

826
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:45,630
I could call your wife a fucking whore
and we could still be friends.

827
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,930
- Calm down.
- Easy for you to say. You can't get scared.

828
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:51,600
- You don't know how, you fucking idiot!
- Take it easy. This has nothing to do with me.

829
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:55,190
Maybe it does. How the fuck would you know?
You don't know a fucking thing!

830
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:59,610
- You can't get scared, but can you get angry?
- Yes.

831
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:02,030
You pathetic piece of shit.

832
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:04,190
I can say whatever the fuck I want...

833
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,860
and you won't have a fucking clue,
you fucking retard!

834
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:09,450
- Shut your mouth.
- You know what? I'm gonna use you.

835
01:15:09,530 --> 01:15:12,040
I'm telling you now,
because I'm gonna enjoy it so much more...

836
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:15,660
if I know that you could stop me
if you weren't such a fucking freak.

837
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:17,540
Did you lose your pen?

838
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:21,040
That's too bad, freak. Otherwise,
you could write yourself a little note...

839
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:24,710
about how much Natalie hates your retarded guts
and that I called your wife a fuckin' whore.

840
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,510
- Don't say another fuckin' word.
- About your whore of a wife?

841
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:33,350
I read about your condition, Leonard.

842
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:38,020
You know what one of the causes of
short-term memory loss is? Venereal disease.

843
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:42,980
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife
sucked one too many diseased cocks...

844
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:44,780
and turned you into a fucking retard!

845
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:50,280
You sad, sad freak.

846
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:54,450
I can say whatever the fuck I want...

847
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:56,960
and you won't remember.

848
01:15:57,790 --> 01:15:59,830
We'll still be best friends...

849
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,460
or maybe even lovers.

850
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:06,880
Fuck.

851
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:14,890
I'll see you soon.

852
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:24,610
Stay focused. Find a pen.

853
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:27,820
Gotta write this down.
Gotta write it down.

854
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,870
Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate.

855
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:35,540
Keep it in mind.
Keep it in mind. Keep it in mind.

856
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:40,920
Come on. Gotta find a pen.
I gotta find a pen.

857
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,960
Write this down.
Write this down, exactly what happened.

858
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:46,920
Gonna write down exactly what happened.
Come on.

859
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:49,340
I gotta find a pen. Geez! Come on.

860
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:51,840
Keep focused. Keep focused.

861
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,390
Keep it in mind.
Come on. Find a pen.

862
01:16:55,470 --> 01:16:57,310
Write this note.
Write down what happened.

863
01:16:57,390 --> 01:17:00,690
Write it down. Concentrate.
Keep it in mind.

864
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,490
What happened?

865
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:12,660
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.

866
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:13,990
Who?

867
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:15,780
Who?

868
01:17:15,870 --> 01:17:18,200
Fuck, Leonard. Dodd.
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

869
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:28,920
Hello?

870
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:34,760
It's Burt, from the front desk.

871
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:39,430
- Yeah?
- I know you said you didn't want any calls.

872
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,060
But this guy called.
He's on the phone now. He says he's a cop.

873
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:43,600
- A cop?
- Yeah.

874
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:47,230
He says you're really gonna wanna
know what he has to say.

875
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:50,900
I'm not too good on the phone. I need to
look people in the eye when I talk to them.

876
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:00,870
You can crash on the couch.
It's comfortable.

877
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,750
Just have a seat.

878
01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:04,290
Thanks.

879
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,260
How long do you think it's gonna take you?

880
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:16,010
You told me you were looking
for the guy who killed your wife?

881
01:18:17,010 --> 01:18:20,720
That depends on if he's here in town
or if he's moved on.

882
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:23,940
I have my file here.

883
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:30,070
Can I ask you something?
If you have all of that information...

884
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:32,530
then why haven't the police
found him for you?

885
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:35,950
- They're not looking for him.
- Why not?

886
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:40,950
They don't think he exists.
You see, I told them what I remembered.

887
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:43,160
I was asleep.

888
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:46,370
Something woke me up.

889
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:54,300
<i>Her side of the bed was cold. She'd
obviously been out of bed for a while.</i>

890
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,860
There had to be a second man.

891
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:57,530
Somebody hit me from behind.
I remember.

892
01:19:57,610 --> 01:19:59,530
It's about the last thing
that I do remember.

893
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:02,370
Look. The police did not believe me.
If we check the police...

894
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:06,250
How did they explain what you do remember?
The gun and stuff.

895
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:11,500
John G. was clever.

896
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:13,090
He was clever.

897
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:17,880
See, he took the dead man's gun, he replaced
it with the sap that he hit me with.

898
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:22,550
He left my gun and he left the getaway car.
He gave the police a complete package.

899
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:26,390
They found the sap with my blood on it
in the dead man's hand.

900
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:29,390
And they only found my gun.

901
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:32,110
They didn't need to look for anybody else.

902
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:36,780
I was the only guy who disagreed with
the facts, and I had brain damage.

903
01:20:37,570 --> 01:20:39,490
The cops are not gonna believe
someone in my condition.

904
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:43,660
Leonard, you can stay here
for a couple of days if it'll help you.

905
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,250
Thanks.

906
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:49,790
I have to go back to work.

907
01:20:49,870 --> 01:20:52,130
So, just make yourself at home.

908
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:56,050
You can watch TV or you can have some food,
whatever you want, okay?

909
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:58,800
- Make yourself at home.
- One thing.

910
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:05,640
- Something to remember you by.
- My name is Natalie.

911
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,020
"Natalie."

912
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:44,390
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

913
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:35,690
- On the house.
- Thanks.

914
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:43,190
You really do have a problem.

915
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,700
Just like that cop said.

916
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,450
Your condition.

917
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:51,040
Nobody's perfect.

918
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:56,040
What's the last thing that you do remember?

919
01:22:59,170 --> 01:23:01,300
- My wife.
- That's sweet.

920
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:02,260
Dying.

921
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:05,630
I remember my wife dying.

922
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:12,310
Let me get you another one.

923
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:15,230
I think this one's dusty.

924
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:21,730
Why are you calling me?
What do you want?

925
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:25,280
I know you're a cop, but what do you want?
Have I done something wrong?

926
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,320
I don't know. Something bad, maybe.

927
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:34,790
Why are you asking me? I can't remember what
I've done. You wouldn't believe me anyway.

928
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:37,790
Because of my condition. You don't
believe someone with this condition.

929
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,840
Nobody believed Sammy!
I didn't even fucking believe Sammy!

930
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:43,170
"Ferdy's Bar."

931
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:48,130
"Come by after. Natalie."

932
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,030
I'll have a beer, please.

933
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:06,110
- What do you want?
- A beer, please.

934
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:08,610
You can't just waltz in here
dressed like that and ask for a beer.

935
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:11,030
- What, is there a dress code?
- Why are you here?

936
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:14,080
- I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
- That's me.

937
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:16,370
Yeah. We met before, right?

938
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:20,000
- Then why am I here?
- I don't know. Why don't you tell me.

939
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,540
I don't remember. I have no
short-term memory. It's not amnesia.

940
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:25,300
- You're the memory guy.
- How do you know about me?

941
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:27,840
My boyfriend told me about you.

942
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:31,840
- Yeah? Who's your boyfriend?
- Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?

943
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:34,470
No.

944
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,020
He knows you. He told me about you.

945
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,190
He said you were staying at the Discount.

946
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:43,310
In fact, a cop came by earlier,
was looking for you.

947
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,570
Said he was looking for a guy
who can't remember anything...

948
01:24:45,650 --> 01:24:47,990
wouldn't know how he got here
or what he'd done.

949
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:50,610
Said I get a lot of guys
around here like that.

950
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:54,160
Chronic alcoholism is one cause
of short-term memory loss.

951
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,960
- Are you Teddy?
- No. My name's Leonard.

952
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,170
- Did Teddy send you?
- I don't know.

953
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:05,420
- What's happened to Jimmy?
- I don't know that either.

954
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,880
- Sorry.
- You don't remember anything?

955
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:11,300
You don't remember where you've been
or what you've just done.

956
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:15,010
No. I can't make new memories.
Everything just fades.

957
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,810
- Then why did you come here?
- I found this in my pocket.

958
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:22,600
<i>Your</i> pocket.

959
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:50,380
Bar bet. Care to contribute?

960
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:52,800
- No, thanks.
- It's for a lot of money.

961
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:56,350
Come on. Proceeds are going to charity.
Help me out.

962
01:26:08,610 --> 01:26:09,900
Thank you.

963
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:29,420
- On the house.
- Thanks.

964
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:36,590
It's completely fucked
because nobody believes you.

965
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:41,060
It's amazing what a little brain damage
will do for your credibility.

966
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:43,930
I guess it's some kind of poetic justice
for not believing Sammy.

967
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:46,190
You know the truth
about my condition, Officer?

968
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:49,020
You don't know anything.

969
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:51,280
You feel angry, you don't know why.

970
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:54,110
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.

971
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:57,570
You could do anything and not have
the faintest idea 10 minutes later.

972
01:26:57,660 --> 01:27:00,030
Like Sammy.
What if I've done something like Sammy?

973
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:04,000
I didn't tell you what happened
to Sammy and his wife?

974
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:08,920
She came to see me at my office. I thought
she was trying to catch me off guard...

975
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,920
<i>so I didn't tell her what I really thought,
but I never said that he was faking...</i>

976
01:27:12,010 --> 01:27:13,920
<i>just that his condition was mental,
not physical.</i>

977
01:27:14,010 --> 01:27:16,970
<i>I found out later that she went home
and gave Sammy his final exam.</i>

978
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,640
Sammy? It's time for my shot.

979
01:27:37,610 --> 01:27:39,620
<i>She knew beyond a doubt that he loved her.</i>

980
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:42,740
<i>So she found a way to test him.</i>

981
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:59,050
Sammy. It's time for my shot.

982
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:11,060
<i>She really thought she'd call his bluff.</i>

983
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:12,650
There you go.

984
01:28:13,230 --> 01:28:17,070
<i>Or she just didn't wanna live
with the things she'd put him through.</i>

985
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,040
Sammy.

986
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:32,330
It's time for my shot.

987
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,590
It won't hurt.

988
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:25,760
<i>She went into a coma and never recovered.</i>

989
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:30,020
<i>Sammy couldn't understand
or explain what happened.</i>

990
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:34,230
He's been in a home ever since.

991
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:36,730
<i>He doesn't even know that his wife is dead.</i>

992
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:40,190
I was wrong about Sammy,
and I was wrong about his wife.

993
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,200
She wasn't interested in the money.

994
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,450
She just needed to understand his problem.

995
01:29:44,530 --> 01:29:47,950
<i>His brain didn't respond to conditioning.
But he wasn't a con man.</i>

996
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:51,460
<i>When she looked into his eyes,
she thought he could be the same person.</i>

997
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:53,920
<i>When I looked into his eyes,
I thought I saw recognition.</i>

998
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,130
Now I know. You fake it.

999
01:29:56,210 --> 01:29:59,050
If you think you're supposed to
recognize somebody, you just pretend to.

1000
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:01,800
<i>You bluff it to get a pat
on the head from the doctors.</i>

1001
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:04,680
You bluff it to seem less of a freak.

1002
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:10,020
What drug dealer?

1003
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:38,540
- Hey, Lenny, how you doing?
- It's private back here.

1004
01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:41,630
- It's okay. We know each other. Right, kid?
- How did you know I was in here?

1005
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,720
The Jag's out front.
Should have put it around back.

1006
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:47,300
What are you still doing here, Lenny?
There's plenty of tattoo parlors up north.

1007
01:30:47,390 --> 01:30:49,890
I guess I wanted to get something down
before it slipped my mind.

1008
01:30:49,970 --> 01:30:52,430
- Give me the keys. I'll move it.
- It'll be all right for a minute.

1009
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,020
Wait out there.

1010
01:30:54,850 --> 01:30:57,440
Give me a minute.
I gotta get something for you.

1011
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:05,240
Fact six: Car license SG 137I U.

1012
01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:13,540
Look. Wait a minute, will ya?

1013
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,080
- We gotta get you out of here.
- Why?

1014
01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:22,460
Man. Come on, Leonard.
How many times I gotta tell you?

1015
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:24,920
- It's not safe for you to hang around here anymore.
- Why not?

1016
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:26,930
Because that cop's looking for you.

1017
01:31:27,010 --> 01:31:29,600
I gotta get you a new identity,
some new clothes.

1018
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:32,310
A different car would do for now.
So put these on.

1019
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:33,770
What cop?

1020
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:37,940
He's a bad cop. He's the one
that checked you into the Discount Inn.

1021
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:41,860
He's been calling you for days, telling you shit,
slipping envelopes under your door. Shit like that.

1022
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:44,650
- How do you know this?
- He told me. He thinks it's funny.

1023
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:46,740
- He's been laughing at you.
- You're full of shit.

1024
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:49,660
I'm not. He knows you're no good on
the phone, so he's been calling you.

1025
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,740
Sometimes you don't answer the phone...

1026
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:54,620
so he slips shit under your door to scare
you into answering the phone again...

1027
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:57,370
giving you a line of crap about John G.
being some local drug dealer.

1028
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:00,710
- Jimmy Grants.
- Who's Jimmy Grants?

1029
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:02,750
Leonard, Jimmy's the drug dealer.

1030
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:05,130
The cop wants to know
how his operation's run.

1031
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:07,220
He's got some score in mind.
Somehow you're involved.

1032
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:08,970
Uh-huh. How do you know him?

1033
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:14,770
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town.
The local boys put us together.

1034
01:32:14,850 --> 01:32:17,180
If he knew I was helping you,
he'd fucking kill me.

1035
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:21,060
So take these clothes, put them on
and get the fuck out of here.

1036
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:23,770
Come on, Leonard. Just go.

1037
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:46,380
You are full of shit.

1038
01:32:48,090 --> 01:32:50,260
"Come by after. Natalie."

1039
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:51,840
"Ferdy's Bar."

1040
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,010
Hey, Jimmy.

1041
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:41,850
I'm sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.

1042
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:43,850
Sorry.

1043
01:33:44,690 --> 01:33:45,940
That's okay.

1044
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:03,370
So this Jimmy Grants deals drugs out
of the bar where his girlfriend works?

1045
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:06,710
But he's not gonna bring her along.
He'll come by himself, right?

1046
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:11,010
I always figured the drugs angle
would be the best way to get him.

1047
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:15,220
No, Officer.
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

1048
01:34:15,930 --> 01:34:18,470
You're in the lobby?
What do you look like?

1049
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:21,730
I'll be right there.

1050
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:04,770
Lenny.

1051
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:09,110
Officer Gammell.

1052
01:35:11,650 --> 01:35:14,360
Yeah. Come on.

1053
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:33,340
- Smile.
- Not here.

1054
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:35,970
Over here.

1055
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:44,640
- Is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?
- You know what?

1056
01:35:44,730 --> 01:35:46,940
Don't write Gammell, just Teddy.

1057
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,650
- Why?
- I'm undercover.

1058
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,900
This is the directions where he's going.

1059
01:35:54,990 --> 01:35:58,030
- My number's on the bottom if you need me.
- You're not coming?

1060
01:35:58,110 --> 01:36:00,030
No. It wouldn't be appropriate.

1061
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:07,660
Nice picture. I look thin.

1062
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:12,670
Hey, Lenny.

1063
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:14,760
Make him beg.

1064
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,090
Teddy!

1065
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:43,800
Hey, Teddy!

1066
01:37:50,770 --> 01:37:51,940
Jimmy.

1067
01:37:53,730 --> 01:37:56,310
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You Jimmy Grants?

1068
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,400
Expecting any otherJimmys out here,
Memory Man?

1069
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:02,740
- Do you remember me?
- Yeah, I remember you.

1070
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:05,240
Where the fuck's Teddy?

1071
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,030
Well?

1072
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:12,960
Motherfuck... Fuckin' retard!

1073
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:18,130
- Strip.
- You're making a big fucking mistake, pal.

1074
01:38:18,210 --> 01:38:19,500
Strip!

1075
01:38:21,590 --> 01:38:24,180
My associates are not
the kind of people you wanna piss off.

1076
01:38:24,260 --> 01:38:25,840
Don't say anything else.

1077
01:38:25,930 --> 01:38:28,350
- I knew I couldn't trust that fuck!
- Take it off.

1078
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:32,520
Cocksucker.

1079
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,400
Your pants too.

1080
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:38,320
- Why?
- I don't wanna get blood on them.

1081
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,400
Wait.
Did he tell you what I was bringing?

1082
01:38:42,490 --> 01:38:46,410
- Take your fuckin' pants off!
- I've got 200 grand stashed in the car!

1083
01:38:46,490 --> 01:38:49,200
- Just take it!
- You think you can bargain with me?

1084
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:51,660
- Take the money and walk away!
- I don't want your fuckin' money.

1085
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:54,160
Then what?

1086
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:58,380
- What do you want from me?
- I want my fuckin' life back!

1087
01:40:28,970 --> 01:40:30,180
Sammy.

1088
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:39,020
He said "Sammy."
How does he know about Sammy?

1089
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:40,480
Oh, fuck.

1090
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:03,080
What have I done?

1091
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,670
Mister, I need help.
There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad.

1092
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,010
- We gotta get him to a doctor.
- All right.

1093
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:14,100
I don't know what happened.
I've got this memory thing.

1094
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:16,390
- Do I know you?
- No. Don't worry. I'm a cop.

1095
01:41:17,220 --> 01:41:20,020
- Is he still breathing?
- I don't know. Maybe.

1096
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:22,650
What the hell were you guys
doing down here?

1097
01:41:24,190 --> 01:41:26,270
I don't remember.
I have this condition.

1098
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:29,070
I hope it's not as serious as his,
'cause this guy's dead.

1099
01:41:29,150 --> 01:41:31,700
Ow! Lenny! That shit kills!

1100
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:35,330
So you remember me now, huh?
You are a fuckin' cop.

1101
01:41:35,410 --> 01:41:38,240
Yeah. And I'm the guy
that helped you find him.

1102
01:41:38,330 --> 01:41:40,210
Get up. Get up.

1103
01:41:40,290 --> 01:41:42,330
Lenny, you got the wrong idea.

1104
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,090
Who is that? He knew me.

1105
01:41:47,170 --> 01:41:49,800
Of course he did. He raped your wife.
He fucked up your brain.

1106
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:51,930
Bullshit. He's not the guy.

1107
01:41:52,010 --> 01:41:56,350
His name is James F. Grants.
John G. Check your tattoos.

1108
01:41:56,430 --> 01:41:58,850
- What was he bringing the 200 grand for?
- What?

1109
01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:03,230
- What was it for?
- A load of amphetamines I told him I had.

1110
01:42:03,310 --> 01:42:06,770
- Is this a drug deal?
- No. Yeah, that and your thing.

1111
01:42:06,860 --> 01:42:10,490
Look, Leonard, Jimmy's your guy. I just
figured we'd make a few dollars on the side.

1112
01:42:10,570 --> 01:42:14,200
- How did he know me?
- The Discount Inn. He dealt out of there.

1113
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:17,580
The guy at the front desk let him know
if anybody came snooping around.

1114
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:20,200
He called Jimmy the minute he saw you
taking a picture of the dump.

1115
01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:22,660
- You're fucking using me.
- No! You get half!

1116
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:25,380
He knew about Sammy!
Why would I tell him about fuckin' Sammy?

1117
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:28,840
You tell everybody about Sammy,
everybody who'll listen.

1118
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:31,050
"Remember SammyJankis?"
"Remember SammyJankis?"

1119
01:42:31,130 --> 01:42:34,050
Great story.
Gets better every time you tell it.

1120
01:42:35,010 --> 01:42:36,930
So you lie to yourself to be happy.

1121
01:42:37,010 --> 01:42:39,060
There's nothing wrong with that.
We all do it.

1122
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:42,270
Who cares if there's a few little details
you'd rather not remember?

1123
01:42:44,730 --> 01:42:47,060
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I don't know.

1124
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:49,770
Your wife surviving the assault.

1125
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:52,490
Her not believing your condition.

1126
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:56,740
The torment and pain and anguish
tearing her up inside.

1127
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:58,620
The insulin.

1128
01:42:59,910 --> 01:43:02,620
That's Sammy, not me.
I told you about Sammy.

1129
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:05,710
Yeah, right.
Like you tell yourself over and over again.

1130
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:07,790
Conditioning yourself to remember.

1131
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:10,460
- Learning through repetition.
- Sammy let his wife kill herself.

1132
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:15,590
- Sammy ended up in an institution.
- Sammy was a con man, a faker.

1133
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,840
I never said that Sammy was faking.

1134
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:20,890
You exposed him for what he was... a fraud.

1135
01:43:20,970 --> 01:43:22,930
But I was wrong.
That's the whole point.

1136
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:27,350
- See, Sammy's wife came to me.
- Sammy didn't have a wife.

1137
01:43:30,110 --> 01:43:32,440
It was <i>your</i> wife who had diabetes.

1138
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:39,820
Ouch.

1139
01:43:42,450 --> 01:43:44,120
My wife wasn't diabetic.

1140
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:46,540
You sure?

1141
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:54,460
- Ouch. Cut it out.
- She wasn't diabetic.

1142
01:43:55,470 --> 01:43:59,260
You think I don't know my own wife?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1143
01:43:59,350 --> 01:44:02,760
I guess I can only make you remember
the things you wanna be true.

1144
01:44:02,850 --> 01:44:05,230
- Like old Jimmy down there.
- He's not the right guy.

1145
01:44:05,310 --> 01:44:07,480
He was to you.

1146
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:10,980
Come on. You got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember.

1147
01:44:11,070 --> 01:44:13,570
What difference does it make
whether he was your guy or not?

1148
01:44:13,650 --> 01:44:16,280
- It makes all the difference.
- Why? You're never gonna know.

1149
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:17,650
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.

1150
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:19,200
I will. Somehow I'll know.

1151
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:21,700
- You won't remember!
- When it's done, I will know. It'll be different.

1152
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:25,700
I thought so too.
In fact, I was sure of it, but you didn't!

1153
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:31,750
That's right. The real John G.

1154
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:35,420
I helped you find him over a year ago.
He's already dead.

1155
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:38,380
- Don't lie to me anymore.
- Look, Lenny.

1156
01:44:39,010 --> 01:44:41,890
I was the cop assigned to your wife's case.
I believed you.

1157
01:44:41,970 --> 01:44:44,510
I thought you deserved
a chance for revenge.

1158
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:47,890
I'm the one that helped you find the
other guy in your bathroom that night...

1159
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:50,310
the guy that cracked your skull
and fucked your wife.

1160
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,860
We found him. You killed him.

1161
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:59,860
But you didn't remember.
So I helped you start looking again...

1162
01:44:59,950 --> 01:45:02,200
looking for the guy you already killed.

1163
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:04,490
Yeah? So who was he?

1164
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:06,950
Just some guy.
Does it even matter who?

1165
01:45:07,710 --> 01:45:11,580
No reason, Lenny. No conspiracy.
Just bad fucking luck.

1166
01:45:12,790 --> 01:45:16,550
Couple ofjunkies too strung out
to realize your wife didn't live alone.

1167
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:21,510
But when you killed him,
I was so convinced that you'd remember.

1168
01:45:22,090 --> 01:45:24,050
But it didn't stick.

1169
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:26,890
Like nothing ever sticks.
Like this won't stick.

1170
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:36,190
I took that picture...
just when you did it.

1171
01:45:38,190 --> 01:45:40,110
Look how happy you are.

1172
01:45:41,450 --> 01:45:43,200
I wanted to see that face again.

1173
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:46,080
- Gee, thanks.
- Fuck you.

1174
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:49,910
I gave you a reason to live,
and you were more than happy to help.

1175
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,170
You don't want the truth.
You make up your own truth.

1176
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:56,210
Like your police file.

1177
01:45:57,050 --> 01:46:00,050
It was complete when I gave it to you.
Who took out the 12 pages?

1178
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:02,680
- You, probably.
- No, it wasn't me. See, it was you.

1179
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:06,470
- Why would I do that?
- To create a puzzle you could never solve.

1180
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,470
You know how many towns?

1181
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,730
How manyJohn G.'s orJames G.'s?

1182
01:46:10,810 --> 01:46:12,850
Shit, Lenny. I'm a fucking John G.

1183
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:16,190
- Your name is Teddy.
- My mother calls me Teddy.

1184
01:46:16,270 --> 01:46:19,150
My name's John Edward Gammell.

1185
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:20,280
Cheer up.

1186
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:23,110
There's plenty ofJohn G.'s for us to find.

1187
01:46:26,490 --> 01:46:28,910
All you do is moan.

1188
01:46:28,990 --> 01:46:31,330
I'm the one that has to live
with what you've done.

1189
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:33,120
I'm the one that put it all together.

1190
01:46:33,210 --> 01:46:37,880
You wander around, you're playing
detective. You're living a dream, kid.

1191
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:42,050
A dead wife to pine for.
A sense of purpose to your life.

1192
01:46:42,130 --> 01:46:45,470
A romantic quest that you wouldn't end
even if I wasn't in the picture.

1193
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:49,930
- I should kill you.
- Quit it. Lenny, come on.

1194
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:53,020
You're not a killer.
That's why you're so good at it.

1195
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:59,320
What are you doing?
You know what time it is?

1196
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,480
It's beer o'clock. I'm buying.

1197
01:47:03,490 --> 01:47:04,610
Fuck.

1198
01:47:14,710 --> 01:47:15,830
I'm not a killer.

1199
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:19,670
I'm just someone who wanted
to make things right.

1200
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:28,090
Can I just let myself forget
what you've told me?

1201
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:48,700
Can I just let myself forget
what you made me do?

1202
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:04,710
You think I just want
another puzzle to solve?

1203
01:48:05,550 --> 01:48:07,720
AnotherJohn G. to look for?

1204
01:48:08,930 --> 01:48:10,800
You're a John G.

1205
01:48:12,510 --> 01:48:14,600
So you can be myJohn G.

1206
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:25,190
Do I lie to myself to be happy?

1207
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:28,240
In your case, Teddy...

1208
01:48:29,370 --> 01:48:31,280
yes, I will.

1209
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:46,510
Hey, that's not your car!

1210
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:49,180
- It is now.
- Jesus Christ, you can't take it!

1211
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:52,180
- Why not?
- Because the guy you just killed owns it!

1212
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:53,970
Somebody'll recognize it!

1213
01:48:55,430 --> 01:48:58,520
I think I'd rather be mistaken
for a dead guy than a killer.

1214
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:01,980
I might hang on to this for a while.

1215
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:04,110
Lenny.

1216
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:08,650
Will you help me find the keys?

1217
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:10,490
Help me find my keys.

1218
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:36,060
I have to believe in a world
outside my own mind.

1219
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:38,310
I have to believe that
my actions still have meaning...

1220
01:49:38,390 --> 01:49:40,350
even if I can't remember them.

1221
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:45,190
I have to believe
that when my eyes are closed...

1222
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:47,360
the world's still here.

1223
01:49:48,570 --> 01:49:50,990
Do I believe the world's still here?

1224
01:49:53,910 --> 01:49:55,490
Is it still out there?

1225
01:49:59,330 --> 01:50:00,330
Yeah.

1226
01:50:02,710 --> 01:50:05,500
We all need mirrors
to remind ourselves who we are.

1227
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,550
I'm no different.

1228
01:50:22,850 --> 01:50:24,650
Now, where was I?
