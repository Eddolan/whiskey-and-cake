1
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:50,843
<i>Mom!</i>

2
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:54,389
<i>Mom! Help me.</i>

3
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:58,560
What is it?

4
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:01,479
I wasn't dreaming, Walt.
I didn't imagine it.

5
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:04,732
I heard him. I heard him. I heard him.
I heard Chris.

6
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:07,610
- I heard him!
- I know.

7
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:10,321
No. I wasn't imagining it, Walt.

8
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,283
No, I did. He's... He's...

9
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:16,703
- I heard him!
- Billie.

10
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:45,685
That's about as far as I can get you.

11
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:47,395
All right. Thank you.

12
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,662
- You left all your shit on my dash.
- Keep it.

13
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,165
Suit yourself.

14
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:09,208
Thanks again.

15
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,045
Hey, hold on a minute.

16
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,219
Here, take these.
They'll keep your feet dry.

17
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:25,516
If you make it out alive, give me a call.
My number's inside the boots.

18
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,018
Thanks.

19
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,005
Hello?

20
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:15,241
Is there anybody here?

21
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,620
Guess not!

22
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,441
Two years he walks the earth.

23
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:39,992
No phone, no pool, no pets,

24
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,620
<i>no cigarettes.</i>

25
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,764
Ultimate freedom.

26
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:07,686
An extremist. An aesthetic voyager

27
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,651
whose home is the road.

28
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,988
"Hey, listen, old man.
Now, don't psychoanalyze me, all right?

29
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:20,991
"Shut up.
I'm taking you out to where we're going."

30
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:22,660
"Where you going?"

31
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,496
"I told you. We're going nowhere!"

32
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,671
So now, after two rambling years
comes the final and greatest adventure.

33
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:38,509
The climactic battle to kill

34
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,845
the false being within

35
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,892
and victoriously conclude
the spiritual revolution.

36
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:21,218
No longer to be poisoned
by civilization, he flees,

37
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,847
and walks alone
upon the land to become

38
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,850
lost in the wild.

39
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:04,428
<i>Hard work and manifold contributions

<i>I see them standing at the formal gates

47
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,884
<i>I see my father strolling out
under the ochre sandstone arch,</i>

48

<i>the red tiles glinting like bent plates
of blood behind his head.</i>

49
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,143
<i>I see my mother
with a few light books at her hip,</i>

50
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:37,855
<i>standing at the pillar made of tiny
bricks with the wrought-iron gates</i>

51
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:42,025
<i>still open behind her,
its sword-tips black in the May air.</i>

52
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,112
<i>They are about to graduate.</i>

53
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:51,076
<i>They are about to get married.
They are kids. They are dumb.</i>

54
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,706
<i>All they know is they are innocent,
they would never hurt anybody.</i>

55
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,670
<i>I want to go up to them and say,
"Stop, don't do it.</i>

<i>"You are going to do things

58
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:13,140

to children.</i>

59
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,809
<i>"You are going to suffer
in ways you never heard of.</i>

60
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:17,895
<i>"You are going to want to die."</i>

61
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:24,401
<i>I want to go up to them there
in the late May sunlight and say it.</i>

62
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,779
<i>But I don't do it. I want to live.</i>

63
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:33,827
<i>I take them up like the male and female
paper dolls, and bang them together</i>

64
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:38,916
<i>at the hips like chips of flint, as if
to strike sparks from them. I say,</i>

65
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:44,963
"Do what you are going to do
and I will tell about it."

66
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,717
Here they are, Walt. Okay?

67
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,345
Who wrote that?

68
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:56,350
Well, could have been either one of us,
couldn't it?

69
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,144
Why is he letting Carine drive his car?

70
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:02,564
There's a lot of great poems in here.

71
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,655
I have to speak to her about it.

72
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:10,781
Sit down.

73
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,534
Excuse me. I'm going to get my son.

74
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:16,787
He just graduated today
from Emory College.

75
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,163
I'll get it. I'll get it.

76
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:21,833
Chris, hi!
We've been waiting and waiting.

77
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:26,296
You scared me half to death
jumping up there on that stage like that.

78
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,800
- Hi, Dad.
- Congratulations, Son.

79
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:33,303
- This is a big step.
- Thank you, Dad.

80
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,138
All right.

81
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,392
You're not supposed to be driving
in Georgia.

82
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,601
Why? I have my permit.

83
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,895
'Cause it's against the law
for a learner's permit

84
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:45,399
to drive in another state
from one's home state. That's why.

85
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:48,902
I didn't know that. I thought that if I was
with a legal driver that it'd be okay.

86
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:49,987
Well, let's...

87
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:02,708
- Are they going to continue?
- No.

88
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:07,671
I guess everybody's celebrating today.

89
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:11,717
- They're going to stay in the bar, right?
- That's right.

90
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,773
My grades are good enough, I think,
to get into Harvard Law.

91
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,817
Chris, that's wonderful.

92
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,362
That is a big deal.

93
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,741
How much do you have left
in the college fund?

94
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:41,288
Exactly $24,500.68.

95
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,040
Well, that's specific.

96
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,876
I had to go to the bank
this morning, Mom.

97
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:51,715
Your mother and I will be glad
to contribute the balance for Harvard.

98
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,258
That's right.

99
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,885
I've got to figure out
what I'm going to do.

100
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:58,430
I've got a lot of things
to pack and organize here first.

101
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:03,018
Your father and I,
we want to make a present to you.

102
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,438
We want to get you out of that junker.

103
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,398
What junker?

104
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,108
That.

105
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:15,864
- We want to buy you a new car.
- That's right.

106
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,407
A new car?

107
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,745
Why would I want a new car?

108
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,539
Datsun runs great.

109
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,877
Do you think I want some fancy boat?

110
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:33,757
Are you worried
what the neighbors might think?

111
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:36,718
Well, we weren't gonna get you
a brand new Cadillac, Chris.

112
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:40,013
We just want to get you a nice new car
that's safe to drive.

113
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:43,684
And you never know when that thing
out there just might blow up.

114
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:49,981
Blow up. Blow up?
Are you guys crazy? It's a great car.

115
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:54,778
I don't need a new car.
I don't want a new car.

116
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,197
- I don't want anything.
- Okay.

117
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,034
- These things, things, things, things.
- Okay.

118
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:02,919
- Everything has to be difficult.
- Thank you.

119
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:05,080
- Thank you.
- Maybe that's not what he means.

120
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:08,834
Maybe he just wants his old car.
It's not such a big deal.

121
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:13,797
Thank you. I just don't want anything.

122
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,559
<i>Chris measured himself
and those around him</i>

123
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,228
<i>by a fiercely rigorous moral code.</i>

124
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:29,438
Bye, Chris!

125
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,858
<i>He risked what could have been
a relentlessly lonely path</i>

126
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:36,653
<i>but found company
in the characters of the books he loved</i>

127
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:43,493
<i>from writers like Tolstoy,
Jack London and Thoreau.</i>

128
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:48,331
<i>He could summon their words
to suit any occasion,</i>

129
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:50,834
<i>and he often would.</i>

130
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:11,271
<i>I forgot to ask what quote he'd have
picked for his graduation dinner,</i>

131
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:14,941
<i>but I had a good idea
of who the primary target would be.</i>

132
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,783
<i>It was inevitable
that Chris would break away.</i>

133
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:28,872
<i>And when he did, he would do it
with characteristic immoderation.</i>

134
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:19,256
<i>"It should not be denied that being
footloose has always exhilarated us.</i>

135
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:23,176
<i>"It is associated in our minds
with escape</i>

136
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:28,181
<i>"from history and oppression and law
and irksome obligations.</i>

137
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,434
<i>"Absolute freedom.</i>

138
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:36,106
<i>"And the road has always led west."</i>

139
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,852
<i>I need a name.</i>

140
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:09,092
<i>Toward the end of June,</i>

141
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:12,220
<i>Emory had mailed our parents
Chris' final grade report.</i>

142
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:14,389
<i>Almost all A's.</i>

143
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,559
<i>A in Apartheid in South African Society.</i>

144
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:22,897
<i>A-minus in Contemporary African
Politics and the Food Crisis in Africa.</i>

145
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:27,152
<i>And on it went. Clever boy, my brother.</i>

146
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:32,449
<i>But by the end of July,
we hadn't heard anything from him</i>

147
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,076
<i>and my parents
were becoming unsettled.</i>

148
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:39,039
<i>Chris had never had a phone,</i>

149
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:42,625
<i>so they decided to drive down
to Atlanta and surprise him.</i>

150
00:25:57,724 --> 00:26:00,477
<i>When they arrived at the apartment,
there was a "For Rent" sign up</i>

151
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,064
<i>and the manager said that Chris
had moved out at the end of May.</i>

152
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:06,191
Oh, yes. He left two months ago.

153
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:08,485
<i>So when they got home,</i>

154
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:12,697
<i>I had to hand them all the letters that
they had sent Chris that summer,</i>

155
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:17,118
<i>which had been returned in a bundle.</i>

156
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:21,706
<i>Chris had arranged for the post office
to hold them until August 1st,</i>

157
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,667
<i>to buy himself some time.</i>

158
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,754
Did you know about this?

159
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:30,256
He didn't say anything.

160
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:34,427
<i>I understood what he was doing.
That he had spent four years</i>

161
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:38,598
<i>fulfilling the absurd and tedious duty
of graduating from college,</i>

162
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:45,688
<i>and now he was emancipated
from that world of abstraction,</i>

163
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:50,318
<i>false security, parents
and material excess,</i>

164
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:55,156
<i>the things that cut Chris off
from the truth of his existence.</i>

165
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,607
Hey!

166
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:17,488
- Hey, man. Step around. Jump in.
- Okay, great.

167
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:21,326
We barely saw you there
underneath that crazy hat of yours.

168
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:25,163
This door's a little tricky.
There you go. Hop in.

169
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,001
That's Rainey.

170
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,794
- Hi, Rainey.
- Yeah, I'm Rainey.

171
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,546
- L'm Jan.
- Hi. I'm Alex.

172
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,964
Alex with the hat on.

173
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:37,133
- Yeah, I know. You said it, man.
- Yeah.

174
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:40,845
So you're a leather now.

175
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:43,181
I'm a leather?

176
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:48,394
Yeah, a leather tramp. That's what they
call the ones that hoof it, go on foot.

177
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:51,439
Technically we're rubber tramps.

178
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,566
Because we have a vehicle.

179
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:58,029
- You don't have to push me away.
- Come on, please?

180
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:04,661
Yeah, Alex could have a vehicle as well,
but he decided to burn all of his money.

181
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,915
And why did you do that?

182
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:14,003
I don't need money.
Makes people cautious.

183
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:18,925
Come on, Alex.
You gotta be a little cautious.

184
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:22,095
I mean, that book of yours is cool
and everything,

185
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:25,473
but you can't depend entirely
on leaves and berries.

186
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:30,228
I don't know if you want to depend on
much more than that.

187
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,189
Where are your mom and dad?

188
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,403
Living their lies somewhere.

189
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:43,950
You look like a loved kid. Be fair.

190
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:46,202
Fair?

191
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:49,038
You know what I mean.

192
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,335
I'll paraphrase Thoreau here.

193
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:59,632
"Rather than love, than money,
than faith,

194
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:03,761
"than fame, than fairness,

195
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,765
"give me truth."

196
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:32,248
<i>From as long ago
as Chris and I could remember,</i>

197
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:35,585
<i>there have been
daily bouts of rage in our house.</i>

198
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:40,173
<i>Violence that we were forced
to witness. It was very real.</i>

199
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:44,677
<i>But it was also like theater.</i>

200
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:50,141
<i>They cast us as both judges
and the accused.</i>

201
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:56,105
And I got you this token,
this expensive token.

202
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,691
<i>Dad had been the young genius</i>

203
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:03,571
<i>that NASA enlisted to do crucial designs
for the American satellite radar systems</i>

204
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:08,201
<i>that would be our answer
to the Russian Sputnik.</i>

205
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:10,703
<i>And Mom and he later started up
a consulting firm</i>

206
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:14,248
<i>combining her
get-up-and-go resourcefulness</i>

207
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:15,958
<i>with his wealth of knowledge.</i>

208
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:18,252
Look at this.

209
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:25,009
<i>But by the time the company
actually made its first million,</i>

210
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:30,139
<i>the careerism and money seemed
only to embolden their blindness.</i>

211
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:32,767
Thank you very, very much.

212
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,354
<i>I remember the first family meeting</i>

213
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:40,149
<i>to let us in on their plans
for getting a divorce.</i>

214
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,320
<i>They wanted us to choose
which of them we'd live with.</i>

215
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:48,157
<i>We cried our eyes out.</i>

216
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,620
<i>The divorce never happened,</i>

217
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:56,499
<i>but the battles and the meetings
never stopped.</i>

218
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,837
<i>It wasn't very long
before Chris and I shut off.</i>

219
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:05,508
<i>We'd say "Go ahead.</i>

220
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,761
<i>"Get the divorce."</i>

221
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:15,101
Jeez. If I struck a match to you I'd have
dinner and warmth at the same time.

222
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:17,854
Where's Jan going?

223
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:21,983
Well, my friend,

224
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:26,028
all is not well on the hippie front.

225
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:38,875
You're an industrious little fucker,
aren't you?

226
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:41,461
Little bit.

227
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:50,845
It's funny how things happen
at particular times.

228
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:56,267
I've loved that woman
for a lot of years, bro.

229
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:01,898
But, you know, she's got a story.

230
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:07,069
We've been going through this thing,
real quiet.

231
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:13,784
So when we ran into you yesterday,

232
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:17,580
this thing that we've been going
through real quiet,

233
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:21,584
she's talking about it.
You know what I mean?

234
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:25,004
- I think I do.
- You think what?

235
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:28,925
Well...

236
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:35,932
Some people feel like
they don't deserve love.

237
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:40,728
They walk away quietly
into empty spaces,

238
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:45,441
trying to close the gaps to the past.

239
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:48,694
That's a hell of an insight. Jesus!

240
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:54,659
- You're not Jesus, are you?
- Look who's talking.

241
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:59,455
You gonna walk across the water
and get her back for me, pal?

242
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:03,918
No. I'm afraid of water.

243
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:06,170
Always have been.

244
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:12,301
Something I've gotta get over sometime
though, huh? So I will swim in it

245
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:15,471
if you'll carry the firewood back to camp.

246
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:19,392
- Shit, yeah.
- Yeah?

247
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,978
- Call it carried.
- All right.

248
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:59,515
<i>"The sea's only gifts are harsh blows,</i>

249
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:06,188
<i>"and, occasionally,
the chance to feel strong.</i>

250
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:10,526
<i>"Now, I don't know much about the sea,</i>

251
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:14,196
<i>"but I do know that
that's the way it is here.</i>

252
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,242
<i>"And I also know
how important it is in life</i>

253
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:22,371
<i>"not necessarily to be strong,
but to feel strong,</i>

254
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:26,125
<i>"to measure yourself at least once,</i>

255
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:32,214
<i>"to find yourself at least once in

257
00:35:37,053 --> 00:35:41,223
<i>"with nothing to help you

258
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:48,689
There's a big wave coming!

259
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:55,029
Rainey, I'm freezing!

260
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:59,784
Could you put your arms around me?

261
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:26,394
The Navy bulldozed and abandoned this
base down there,

262
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:33,484
and all that's left is this huge grid
of concrete foundations, or slabs.

263
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:37,988
- Man, you would dig the Slabs.
- You would like it. You would like it.

264
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:40,282
- If you're on the road still.
- You'd love it.

265
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:41,826
Fellow travelers.

266
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:44,537
Just living on the cheap under the sun.
Can't beat it.

267
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,996
Sounds good.

268
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:48,833
If you come, I'll make you a proper hat.

269
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:52,044
- Promise?
- I swear to God.

270
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,555
Oh, baby. Baby.

271
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:05,474
- Stop it. Wait.
- Yeah.

272
00:37:08,144 --> 00:37:10,604
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.

273
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:13,941
Let me turn off the light.

274
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:59,862
- He reminded me of...
- I know.

275

00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:23,177
<i>Just where to put all your faith
And how will it grow?</i>

278
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:27,640
<i>Gonna rise up</i>

279
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:32,353
<i>Burning back holes in dark memories</i>

280
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,731
<i>Gonna rise up</i>

281
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:40,152
<i>Turning mistakes into gold</i>

282
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:43,906
I mean, you're really good.
I mean, you're like

283
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:50,079
100,000 times better than, like,
any apple I've ever had.

284
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:54,250
I'm not Superman, I'm Supertramp.

285
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:58,337
You're Superapple.

286
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:05,135
You're so tasty.
You're so organic, so natural.

287
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:08,430
You're the apple of my eye.

288
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:17,314
<i>Hey! Such is the passage of time
Too fast to fold</i>

289
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:25,155
<i>And suddenly swallowed by signs
Lo and behold</i>

290
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:29,285
<i>Gonna rise up</i>

291
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:33,956
<i>Find my direction magnetically</i>

292
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:37,209

<i>Throw down my ace in the hole</i>

294
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:48,387
<i>In early September, Mom and Dad
got a call from the Annandale police</i>

295

<i>notifying them that
Chris' abandoned car</i>

296

<i>had been identified
by the Arizona Highway Patrol.</i>

297
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:58,731
<i>A group of rare flower hunters
stumbled upon it in the desert.</i>

298
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:03,611
<i>There were no signs that
Chris had intended to return to it.</i>

299
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:06,864
<i>But there wasn't
any evidence of struggle, either.</i>

300
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:11,201
<i>The police thought
Chris had chosen to leave it behind</i>

301
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:13,996
<i>and not that it was taken from him.</i>

302
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:22,504
<i>The initial comfort
that gave Mom and Dad quickly turned</i>

303
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:27,343
<i>to the realization that Chris
was actually trying not to be found.</i>

304
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:09,885
Strong.

305
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:15,516
You can do anything.
You can go anywhere.

306
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:22,314
<i>Money, power is an illusion.
It's up here.</i>

307
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:25,401
You can be here.

308
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:29,196
Me and you.

309
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:48,215
One, two. No, no, no.

310
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,433
Two,

311
00:42:02,104 --> 00:42:03,272
three...

312
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,533
Don't be shy with it. Get it moving there.
That's good.

313
00:42:57,076 --> 00:42:58,911
- That's your speed right here.
- Right.

314
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,164
You go too fast,
you won't get all the wheat.

315
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:05,084
That's it, straight line, straight line,
little straighter.

316
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:08,504
See how you're bearing? Just a little
straighter. Now you're a combiner.

317
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:10,672
Wow, look at this view!

318
00:43:10,756 --> 00:43:13,425
But keep your eye on the wheat, here.
Make sure you're cutting it.

319
00:43:13,509 --> 00:43:16,720
You can look back here and see
how much is coming out, all right.

320
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:18,430
- How do you feel?
- I feel great.

321
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:21,600
Okay, keep it straight. God bless you.

322
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:23,977
Make yourself some money, my friend.
I'll see you in a little bit.

323
00:43:24,061 --> 00:43:25,145
Okay.

324
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,697
Wayne. Where you going?

325
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:58,887
Kevin, you know I love you.
I'm joking with you. I'm joking. Stop it.

326
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:02,307
- L'm joking with you.
- Mind your own business, Wayne!

327
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:04,560
- What are you getting so hostile for?
- I don't know.

328
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:06,979
Me and you are on the same side.
We're on the same side.

329
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:10,149
- L'm just tired of the teasing a lot.
- Kevin, we're on the same side.

330
00:44:10,232 --> 00:44:14,862
Let me get some...
If I want some vagina, let me get it.

331
00:44:14,945 --> 00:44:17,489
- Whoa. He's serious about this.
- Let's just play cards.

332
00:44:17,573 --> 00:44:19,158
- Can we just play cards?
- Let's go, then.

333
00:44:19,241 --> 00:44:21,994
$2, $4, $6, just put all the money in.

334
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:23,912
I just wanna see
everybody going for broke.

335
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:26,582
- You want to play?
- No.

336
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:43,348
- Kevin, what have you got for the week?
- I got 260.

337
00:44:43,432 --> 00:44:45,142
We're at 260.

338
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:53,527
We're gonna stay right at 260,
that's our number.

339
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:55,402
We've got 20,000 pounds.

340
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:59,364
We've got 20,000 pounds
we need to get rid of.

341
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:06,205
Maybe just do all that after lunch
before we get back into everything else.

342
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:09,791
Can we do the $500 reserves...

343
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:21,220
What do you think about all this?

344
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:23,639
I like all this.

345
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:38,111
I don't think he can do it.

346
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,325
Is there a library
or bookstore around here

347
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,494
where I can get books
on hunting and preserving?

348
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,579
Anything at all to do with hunting
or preserving the meat,

349
00:45:47,663 --> 00:45:49,748
smoking it, whatever the hell it is,

350
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:52,709
talk to Kevin over there.
That's your man.

351
00:45:53,043 --> 00:45:56,255
Outdoorsman. What's your fascination
with all that stuff?

352
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:57,965
I'm going to Alaska.

353
00:45:58,298 --> 00:46:01,218
Alaska, Alaska? Or city Alaska?

354
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:03,845
Because they do have markets
in Alaska.

355
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:07,099
The city of Alaska. Not in Alaska.
In the city of Alaska, they have markets.

356
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:10,477
No, man. Alaska, Alaska.

357
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:14,815
I'm gonna be all the way out there,
all the way fucking out there.

358
00:46:15,524 --> 00:46:16,733
Just on my own.

359
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:22,322
You know, no fucking watch,
no map, no ax, no nothing. No nothing.

360
00:46:22,406 --> 00:46:25,117
Just be out there. Just be out there in it.

361
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,579
You know, big mountains, rivers,
sky, game.

362
00:46:29,663 --> 00:46:33,542
Just be out there in it, you know?
In the wild.

363
00:46:33,709 --> 00:46:35,627
- In the wild.
- Just wild.

364
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:37,713
- Yeah.
- Just...

365
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:38,880
What are you doing when we're there?

366
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:41,174
Now you're in the wild,
what are we doing?

367
00:46:41,258 --> 00:46:42,426
You're just living, man.

368
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:45,929
You're just there, in that moment,
in that special place and time.

369
00:46:46,013 --> 00:46:47,222
Yeah.

370
00:46:47,347 --> 00:46:49,891
Maybe when I get back,
I can write a book about my travels.

371
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:50,976
Why not?

372
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:53,145
You know,
about getting out of this sick society.

373
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:56,023
- Society!
- Society!

374
00:46:56,106 --> 00:46:57,691
- Society, man!
- Society!

375
00:46:57,774 --> 00:46:59,985
Society! Society! Society!

376
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:02,821
Society, you know! Society!

377
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:06,283
'Cause you know
what I don't understand?

378
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:10,329
I don't understand why people,
why every fucking person

379
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:13,790
is so bad to each other so fucking often.

380
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:19,004
It doesn't make sense to me. Judgment.
Control. All that, the whole spectrum.

381
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:22,924
- Well, it just...
- What "people" we talking about?

382
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:29,264
You know, parents, hypocrites,

383
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:33,602
politicians, pricks.

384
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,689
This is a mistake.

385
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:41,443
It's a mistake to get too deep
into all that kind of stuff.

386
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:47,366
Alex, you're a hell of a young guy,
a hell of a young guy.

387
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,869
But I promise you this.

388
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,666
You're a young guy! Can't be juggling
blood and fire all the time!

389
00:47:57,125 --> 00:48:00,379
- You've got to just kind of...
- Wayne, what are you talking about?

390
00:48:00,462 --> 00:48:01,880
- What?
- I mean...

391
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:03,284
I'm talking about blood and fire.

392
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:05,384
We're talking about
trying to juggle blood and fire.

393
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:07,177
Who are you to be giving advice
to anybody anyway?

394
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,845
Who am I to be giving advice
to anybody?

395
00:48:08,929 --> 00:48:10,555
- Yes.
- Well, it's nice to meet you.

396
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:12,432
- My name is Mr. Happy.
- Mr. Happy.

397
00:48:12,516 --> 00:48:14,768
And Mr. Happy sometimes gives advice.

398
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:16,895
- Alex, please.
- L'm sorry.

399
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:19,606
Sometimes Mr. Happy...
Well, Mr. Happy is always happy.

400
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:21,149
But you know when he's happiest?

401
00:48:21,233 --> 00:48:22,609
- He's not always happy.
- When is he happy?

402
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:25,237
Are you really gonna say that to me?
Come on, tell me about it.

403
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,280
I am going to say that to you.

404
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,663
- Now...
- Sit down before you hurt yourself.

405
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:37,958
One thing that you should try
to keep your eye on

406
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:41,670
is what happened
in the late 1940s in Roswell.

407
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:57,853
<i>When a search of tax records
revealed that</i>

408
00:48:57,936 --> 00:49:00,522
<i>Chris had given
his life savings to charity,</i>

409
00:49:00,856 --> 00:49:05,193
<i>Mom and Dad became
what Dad called "mobilized."</i>

410
00:49:05,277 --> 00:49:09,781
<i>They hired a private investigator and
notified law enforcement nationwide,</i>

411
00:49:10,073 --> 00:49:12,451
<i>determined to track him down.</i>

412
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:17,330
<i>I just figured he'd be with gypsies,
far from the eyes of the law.</i>

413
00:49:21,418 --> 00:49:23,795
These are those free satellite TV deals.

414
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:26,798
You're the one who said it, Alex, not me.

415
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,470
You're gonna need something.
What kind of gun you got?

416
00:49:31,553 --> 00:49:35,891
I'm probably gonna get like a .22,
I think. A .22 caliber rifle.

417
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:39,561
All right, then.

418
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,814
When you get your kill,
time is of the essence.

419
00:49:42,898 --> 00:49:44,983
Now, the first thing you wanna do
is make sure

420
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:48,069
that you got that meat
nice and shaved up.

421
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:50,739
And you don't have a lot of time to do
this. This is about an hour or two.

422
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:54,743
Depending on the weather. Especially if
it's hot, you've got less time to do it.

423
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:58,997
What you do is you want to make sure
that them flies don't land on your meat.

424
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,918
Because once them flies start
shitting out larvae and them maggots,

425
00:50:03,627 --> 00:50:07,672
you know, those creepy crawlies,
it's too late. It's too late.

426
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:17,576
You got me. You got me.

427
00:51:23,373 --> 00:51:25,959
I warned Wayne
about them little black boxes.

428
00:51:26,126 --> 00:51:29,754
Mr. Westerberg, Scott Baker, FBI.
I think you know why we're here.

429
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:32,007
- Impressive turn-out.
- Yeah.

430
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:35,176
You mind grabbing that zipper
for me there? Thank you.

431
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:37,012
- Let's go.
- Sorry, boys.

432
00:51:37,095 --> 00:51:39,347
We're gonna have to shut down
for a little while.

433
00:51:39,431 --> 00:51:42,183
Alex, you come back
and work for me any time you want.

434
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:44,978
Gil's got your checks, guys.
I shouldn't be away too long.

435
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:49,941
Remember Alex, no Alaska till spring.
South, kid. You wanna head south.

436
00:52:15,508 --> 00:52:17,886
<i>The year Chris graduated high school,</i>

437
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:21,389
<i>he bought the Datsun used
and drove it cross-country.</i>

438
00:52:22,724 --> 00:52:24,893
<i>He stayed away most of the summer.</i>

439
00:52:25,477 --> 00:52:27,979
Come on. The neighbors
are gonna be watching, honey.

440
00:52:28,063 --> 00:52:29,397
Can you spray it?

441
00:52:34,736 --> 00:52:38,907
<i>As soon as I heard he was home,
I ran into his room to talk to him.</i>

442
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:47,290
<i>In California,
he'd looked up some old family friends.</i>

443
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:52,921
<i>He discovered that our parents' stories
of how they fell in love and got married</i>

444
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:55,882
<i>were calculated lies
masking an ugly truth.</i>

445
00:52:57,092 --> 00:52:59,761
<i>When they met,
Dad was already married.</i>

446
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:03,014
<i>And even after Chris was born,</i>

447
00:53:03,098 --> 00:53:05,975
<i>Dad had had another son
with his first wife, Marcia,</i>

448
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,938
<i>to whom he was still legally married.</i>

449
00:53:11,898 --> 00:53:17,112
<i>This fact suddenly re-defined
Chris and me as bastard children.</i>

450
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:26,496
<i>Dad's arrogance made him conveniently
oblivious to the pain he caused.</i>

451
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:32,293
<i>And Mom, in the shame and
embarrassment of a young mistress,</i>

452
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:35,422
<i>became his accomplice in deceit.</i>

453
00:53:40,844 --> 00:53:44,597
<i>The fragility of crystal is not
a weakness but a fineness.</i>

454
00:53:45,765 --> 00:53:48,893
<i>My parents understood that
a fine crystal glass had to be cared for</i>

455
00:53:48,977 --> 00:53:51,396
<i>or it may be shattered.</i>

456
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:55,734
<i>But when it came to my brother,
they did not seem to know or care</i>

457
00:53:55,817 --> 00:53:58,069
<i>that their course of secret action</i>

458
00:53:58,153 --> 00:54:02,240
<i>brought the kind of devastation
that could cut them.</i>

459
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:08,538
<i>Their fraudulent marriage
and our father's denial of this other son</i>

460
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:13,001
<i>was, for Chris,
a murder of every day's truth.</i>

461
00:54:14,127 --> 00:54:17,964
<i>He felt his whole life turn,
like a river suddenly reversing</i>

462
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:22,135
<i>the direction of its flow,
suddenly running uphill.</i>

463
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:33,438
<i>These revelations struck at the core
of Chris' sense of identity.</i>

464
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:37,567
<i>They made his entire childhood
seem like fiction.</i>

465
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:41,279
<i>Chris never told them he knew</i>

466
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:47,243
<i>and made me promise silence, as well.</i>

467
00:54:48,036 --> 00:54:50,288
I can't afford four.
Who's gonna pay for the fourth one?

468
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:53,541
Bryan can't afford four. Does it matter?

469
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:55,919
Can I help you?

470
00:54:56,002 --> 00:54:58,463
Yeah. If I wanted
to paddle down the river,

471
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:00,715
where's the best place to launch out of?

472
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:01,966
Hang on a second.

473
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:05,261
"To launch out of?"
What's your experience level?

474
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:09,682
- Not much.
- Any? Do you have a permit?

475
00:55:09,766 --> 00:55:11,810
A permit? Permit for what?

476
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:14,687
You can't paddle down the river
without a permit.

477
00:55:14,771 --> 00:55:17,171
If you want, you can apply for one here,
get some experience,

478
00:55:17,232 --> 00:55:19,150
and I'll put you on the wait-list.

479
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:21,903
No, I got this guy in here.
We'll figure it out.

480
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:24,572
There's a wait-list
to paddle down a river?

481
00:55:24,656 --> 00:55:26,074
That's right.

482
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:28,618
- Yeah, it's gonna be...
- Well, how long do I have to wait?

483
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:30,161
Yeah, hang on a second.

484
00:55:30,245 --> 00:55:34,290
Now, the deal is
it's gonna be me and you

485
00:55:34,374 --> 00:55:37,710
or it's gonna be me, you and her.

486
00:55:37,794 --> 00:55:42,382
Next available is May 17th, 2003.

487
00:55:43,258 --> 00:55:47,262
Great. Done. The three of us, then.

488
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:48,930
Twelve years?

489
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:51,349
- What's that?
- Twelve years?

490
00:55:51,516 --> 00:55:53,101
To paddle down a river.

491
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:55,019
Let me call you back.

492
00:55:55,645 --> 00:55:57,480
You can do that,

493
00:55:57,564 --> 00:56:00,692
or you can join a commercial raft trip,
go with a licensed guide.

494
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:02,535
They may have some
last-minute cancellations,

495
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:05,154
but that's gonna cost you $2,000.

496
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:08,700
Thank you very much.

497
00:56:46,446 --> 00:56:48,072
Helmet, man!

498
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:28,738
I'm Supertramp!

Hey. I'm Sonja.

Hey, Alex.

511
00:58:56,534 --> 00:59:00,747
We are from Copenhagen,
and you are from the rapids.

- You're crazy! You're crazy, man.
- My God!

514
00:59:12,133 --> 00:59:15,178
Sonja, get away from him. Get away
from him. He's crazy! Look, he's crazy.

515
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:17,472
I'll make you a hot dog. One minute.

516
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:23,728
I love this. Don't you love this?

517
00:59:23,936 --> 00:59:27,315
You know, this is nature.

518
00:59:36,449 --> 00:59:38,326
So where are you going?

519
00:59:38,993 --> 00:59:41,537
- I haven't decided yet.
- Really?

520
00:59:41,621 --> 00:59:44,957
Well, we like it here very much.
And it's so good to meet you, man.

521
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:46,167
So good to meet you.

522
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:50,296
You know, we went to Los Angeles,
and then we went to Las Vegas.

523
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:55,259
Oh, yeah. Las Vegas is very nice.
The universe is so good.

524
01:00:00,181 --> 01:00:02,975
- The universe is very good.
- You know what I mean?

525
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:05,311
- Yeah.
- The whole universe.

526
01:00:05,478 --> 01:00:09,774
Just the place. The city, she means.
Her English is not very good.

527
01:00:09,899 --> 01:00:14,862
But then we came here. I don't care
if she's a little stupid, but I like her.

528
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:18,630
You know you can actually go
all the way down to Mexico from here.

529
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:19,742
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

530
01:00:19,826 --> 01:00:24,372
You can take the kayak,
and you can take it all the way around

531
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:26,833
down to Hoover Dam,
you can sail around,

532
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:31,379
and then from there you can take
the river all the way down to Mexico!

533
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:33,548
- Really?
- Yeah.

534
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:39,220
Come on, come on!

535
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,056
She's so slow sometimes.

536
01:00:43,057 --> 01:00:46,602
- Here's the map.
- But I like her.

537
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,399
- Here. Hoover Dam.
- Okay.

538
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:53,860
About 330 kilometers, I think.

539
01:00:53,943 --> 01:00:56,821
- Miles?
- Yeah, miles, about 200 miles.

540
01:00:56,904 --> 01:01:00,992
- Two hundred miles.
- Two hundred miles. Yeah, man.

541
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:02,952
You know, I wonder if I could paddle

542
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:05,163
all the way down that
into the Gulf of California.

543
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:08,082
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can.
You know, I will go with you.

544
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:11,085
I will go with you. We leave Sonja here,
and then we take the kayak.

545
01:01:11,169 --> 01:01:13,421
No, no.
We go all the way down into Mexico.

546
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:18,259
You know, because in every man's
heart, there is a Mexican mistress.

547
01:01:34,984 --> 01:01:36,736
Oh, man.

548
01:01:37,236 --> 01:01:39,530
I've gotta go, you guys.
I'm really sorry. I gotta go.

549
01:01:39,614 --> 01:01:41,490
- What's going on?
- Why?

550
01:01:41,574 --> 01:01:45,203
The river patrol's after me. I'm actually
not supposed to be here, you know.

551
01:01:45,286 --> 01:01:46,871
You have to have, like, a permit,

552
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:50,625
it's like a government thing to be here,
and I didn't get one.

553
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:52,585
If you see anybody,
any of the rangers or anything,

554
01:01:52,668 --> 01:01:54,545
just tell them you didn't see me, okay?

555
01:01:54,629 --> 01:01:55,713
Okay.

556
01:01:55,796 --> 01:02:00,343
Okay, again, I'm really, really sorry,
man. I wish I could stay, you know.

557
01:02:00,426 --> 01:02:01,427
Take care, man.

558
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:02,553
- All right. Take care, Mads.
- Nice to meet you.

559
01:02:02,637 --> 01:02:05,556
- Bye, Alex.
- I wish... I wish I could stay.

560
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,975
Say hello to Mexico from me.

561
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:12,563
Bye, Alex!

562
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:47,765
<i>It would be Christmas
in a couple of months,</i>

563
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:51,727
<i>and the last news we'd had
was about his car being found.</i>

564
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:56,649
<i>I woke up a couple of days ago,
and for the first time, it bothered me</i>

565
01:02:56,857 --> 01:03:00,278
<i>that it wasn't only my parents
who hadn't heard from Chris.</i>

566
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:01,487
Honey?

567
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:06,117
It's me. I'm sorry.
Everything that happened, it's my fault.

568
01:03:07,702 --> 01:03:09,620
Give me another chance.

569
01:03:11,372 --> 01:03:14,875
Please do that... Come on.
Do that for me.

570
01:03:18,004 --> 01:03:20,298
Come on. They're calling
for another quarter right now,

571
01:03:20,381 --> 01:03:23,009
and I ain't got it, so
will you hurry it up?

572
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:26,429
Come on now, don't hang up on me.

573
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:30,308
Hey, here's a quarter.

574
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:31,726
Thank you.

575
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:35,771
There's a quarter
just happened out of the sky,

576
01:03:35,855 --> 01:03:39,233
so I'm on here talking to you again.

577
01:03:40,443 --> 01:03:43,946
I got the quarter now, let's...
No, no, no, no, no!

578
01:03:48,784 --> 01:03:52,621
<i>I wondered why he hadn't tried to call
in case I might answer.</i>

579
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:55,458
<i>He could've hung up if it wasn't me.</i>

580
01:03:56,625 --> 01:04:00,254
<i>Why wouldn't he send a letter,
maybe through a friend?</i>

581
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:01,964
<i>It hurt a little,</i>

582
01:04:04,383 --> 01:04:07,011
<i>but I told myself it was good.</i>

583
01:04:09,096 --> 01:04:12,933
<i>He knew I loved him enough
to bear with the not knowing.</i>

584
01:04:15,061 --> 01:04:19,398
<i>And it helped me remember that there
was something more than rebellion,</i>

585
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:22,276
<i>more than anger that was driving him.</i>

586
01:04:28,783 --> 01:04:32,578
<i>Chris had always been driven,
had always been an adventurer.</i>

587
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:48,636
<i>When he was four years old,</i>

588
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:53,766
<i>he once wandered six blocks away
from home at 3:00 in the morning.</i>

589
01:05:00,481 --> 01:05:02,775
<i>He was found in a neighbor's kitchen</i>

590
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:06,112
<i>up on a chair,
digging through their candy drawer.</i>

591
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:13,452
<i>Whatever drawer he was opening now
must have something pretty sweet in it.</i>

592
01:07:11,737 --> 01:07:15,658
<i>- You lived in a cave for 36 days?
- Yes, sir.</i>

593
01:07:15,783 --> 01:07:17,785
<i>And how did you get into Mexico
in the first place?</i>

594
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:20,454
<i>Through the spillway at Morelos Dam.</i>

595
01:07:20,913 --> 01:07:22,915
<i>River dries out pretty quickly
beyond there, doesn't it?</i>

596
01:07:22,998 --> 01:07:27,795
<i>Yeah. Turns into a maze of irrigation
canals, thanks to our dams up north.</i>

597
01:07:28,212 --> 01:07:32,132
<i>So I ported my kayak over the desert,
and I hitched down to Golfo.</i>

598
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:37,471
<i>But after</i> a <i>few weeks,</i> a <i>sandstorm
came up and blew the kayak</i> away.

599
01:07:37,805 --> 01:07:40,140
<i>So I walked back north. Here I am.</i>

600
01:07:40,224 --> 01:07:43,936
<i>Well, you just can't be crossing
the borders without any identification.</i>

601
01:07:44,019 --> 01:07:45,896
- Are we understood?
- Yes, sir.

602
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:48,440
I've eaten enough sand to send me
back to the city anyway.

603
01:07:48,524 --> 01:07:51,235
All right. Sit tight. I'll be right back.

604
01:07:52,653 --> 01:07:56,699
<i>Some may ask,
"Why act now? Why not wait?"</i>

605
01:07:57,491 --> 01:08:01,245
<i>The answer is clear.
The world could wait no longer.</i>

606
01:10:27,474 --> 01:10:29,184
Hi. Do you have the time?

607
01:10:29,643 --> 01:10:31,103
- Time?
- Time?

608
01:10:31,186 --> 01:10:32,438
Yeah.

609
01:10:33,731 --> 01:10:35,149
Okay.

610
01:11:16,064 --> 01:11:17,441
Front and back.

611
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:21,528
I don't have any more clipboards,
so get one from the other fellas.

612
01:11:21,779 --> 01:11:23,280
- Next.
- Hi.

613
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:25,908
Can you tell me how to get an ID?

614
01:11:26,074 --> 01:11:28,827
- Did you lose your identification, sir?
- Yeah.

615
01:11:28,911 --> 01:11:31,497
No birth certificate? Nothing?

616
01:11:31,747 --> 01:11:32,873
Ouch.

617
01:11:33,165 --> 01:11:36,919
All right. Well, you're gonna
have to work that out with the DMV.

618
01:11:37,002 --> 01:11:41,298
You can catch them in the morning.
The closest one is Montebello,

619
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:44,301
and we can help you
with the bus voucher.

620
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:46,470
So just come to this desk
when you're ready for the voucher.

621
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:48,180
- Okay.
- What's your name?

622
01:11:48,263 --> 01:11:51,934
- Alexander Supertramp.
- What's that?

623
01:11:52,017 --> 01:11:57,898
- Alexander Supertramp.
- Supertramp. Really?

624
01:11:58,148 --> 01:11:59,149
Yeah.

625
01:12:00,275 --> 01:12:04,029
Okay, so I'm gonna look for you,
Supertramp. I got something for you.

626
01:12:06,532 --> 01:12:08,951
- Here you go, Supertramp.
- Thank you very much.

627
01:12:09,034 --> 01:12:10,327
Okay, baby.

628
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:13,455
- And one last thing.
- Yeah.

629
01:12:15,374 --> 01:12:17,793
Do you have a bed for me? I'm sorry...

630
01:12:17,876 --> 01:12:21,672
Oh, no. Sure, I got a bed for you.
Sign your name right here.

631
01:12:21,755 --> 01:12:24,350
You fill this out. And
I'll set you right up.

632
01:12:24,363 --> 01:12:26,969
Now, I'm out of...

633
01:12:27,052 --> 01:12:29,888
- What's going on back there?
- I got it. I'm sorry.

634
01:12:29,972 --> 01:12:33,350
- Come on, now. Work with me.
- All right. Thanks, ma'am.

635
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:35,769
Supertramp, huh?

636
01:12:38,689 --> 01:12:40,607
You know the drill.

637
01:13:13,849 --> 01:13:15,392
Move it!

638
01:14:02,981 --> 01:14:05,609
Thanks, but I'm not gonna need
that bed after all.

639
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:07,903
You leaving us so soon? Supertramp!

640
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:15,929
Show me your face.
I never, ever, ever forget a face.

641
01:15:16,346 --> 01:15:19,349
If I see yours again,
I won't arrest you, I'll kill you.

642
01:15:19,433 --> 01:15:21,309
This is the goddamned railroad,

643
01:15:21,393 --> 01:15:23,020
and we will do whatever we have to do

644
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:25,522
to keep you freeloaders
from violating our liability.

645
01:15:25,605 --> 01:15:26,898
Yes, sir.

646
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:32,279
You got any ID?

647
01:15:33,613 --> 01:15:36,825
- No, sir.
- Of course you don't.

648
01:15:37,701 --> 01:15:39,494
Last time, my friend.

649
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:41,955
All clear.

650
01:15:49,963 --> 01:15:51,339
Good boy!

651
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:12,486
<i>Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
Finally!</i>

652
01:16:15,697 --> 01:16:18,867
<i>It's a mystery to me</i>

653
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:25,082
<i>We have a greed
With which we have agreed</i>

654
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:31,338
<i>You think you have to want more
than you need</i>

655
01:16:32,547 --> 01:16:37,260
<i>Until you have it all you won't be freed</i>

656
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:45,602
<i>Society, you're a crazy breed</i>

657
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:52,109
<i>I hope you're not lonely without me</i>

658
01:16:55,529 --> 01:17:00,575
<i>When you want more than you have
You think you need</i>

659
01:17:01,493 --> 01:17:06,373
<i>And when you think more than you want
Your thoughts begin to bleed</i>

660
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:12,879
<i>I think I need to find a bigger place</i>

661
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:15,757
<i>'Cause when you have
more than you think</i>

662
01:17:15,841 --> 01:17:18,051
<i>You need more space</i>

663
01:17:21,638 --> 01:17:27,060
<i>Society, you're a crazy breed</i>

664
01:17:27,561 --> 01:17:32,524
<i>I hope you're not lonely without me</i>

665
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:38,488
<i>Society, crazy indeed</i>

666
01:17:39,406 --> 01:17:45,745
<i>I hope you're not lonely without me</i>

667
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:36,588
Thanks a lot.

668
01:18:45,805 --> 01:18:48,767
<i>L n the letters
Chris wrote me from college,</i>

669
01:18:49,309 --> 01:18:53,521
<i>it was clear his anguish and problems
with Mom and Dad had continued.</i>

670
01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:04,866
<i>He said I was
the only person in the world</i>

671
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:07,577
<i>who could possibly understand
what he had to say.</i>

672
01:19:07,661 --> 01:19:10,664
With whose money are you buying
all these goddamn presents?

673
01:19:10,747 --> 01:19:13,166
I work. The only reason
I'm not talking is because

674
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:15,919
you're wandering around acting like
the big-shot flirt with everybody.

675
01:19:16,002 --> 01:19:19,589
I am making the contacts
for this business to work!

676
01:19:19,714 --> 01:19:21,675
You don't care at all about what I do!

677
01:19:21,758 --> 01:19:23,593
I don't even want to talk to you
about it anymore!

678
01:19:23,677 --> 01:19:26,763
Don't you walk away from me, woman!
Woman!

679
01:19:27,389 --> 01:19:29,766
Kids! Look what your dad
is doing to me!

680
01:19:29,933 --> 01:19:33,270
For God's sake,
look what your mother is making me do!

681
01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:35,355
Fuck you! I hate you!

682
01:19:37,732 --> 01:19:40,902
There ain't gonna be no party.
I'm gonna cancel Christmas this year.

683
01:19:41,027 --> 01:19:44,281
<i>Cancel Christmas?
Who do you think you are? God?</i>

684
01:19:44,364 --> 01:19:46,199
<i>That's right! I'm God!</i>

685
01:19:46,283 --> 01:19:49,119
<i>Well, you're not God.
You can't cancel Christmas.</i>

686
01:19:49,369 --> 01:19:50,704
<i>That's bullshit!</i>

687
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:48,321
We're 10 deep!

688
01:21:56,204 --> 01:22:01,000
Alex, I don't mean to be on you about
everything. You're doing a great job.

689
01:22:01,209 --> 01:22:04,921
I wanna keep you on and
we all wanna help you get to Alaska,

690
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:08,216
but you've got to start wearing socks.

691
01:22:16,141 --> 01:22:19,853
<i>With almost a year having passed
since Chris' disappearance,</i>

692
01:22:20,395 --> 01:22:23,773
<i>my parents' anger, their desperation,</i>

693
01:22:23,857 --> 01:22:26,192
<i>their guilt was giving way to pain.</i>

694
01:22:29,195 --> 01:22:31,823
<i>And pain seemed to bring them closer.</i>

695
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:36,369
<i>Even their faces had changed.</i>

696
01:23:02,562 --> 01:23:05,023
<i>She convinces herself it's Chris,</i>

697
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:09,736
<i>that it's her son
whenever she passes a stray.</i>

698
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:13,907
<i>And I fear for the mother in her.</i>

699
01:23:17,577 --> 01:23:22,582
<i>Instincts that seem to sense the threat
of</i> a <i>loss so huge</i>

700
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:27,378
<i>and irrevocable that the mind balks
at taking its measure.</i>

701
01:23:29,589 --> 01:23:34,177
<i>I'd begin to wonder if I can understand
all that Chris is saying any longer,</i>

702
01:23:37,347 --> 01:23:40,308
<i>but I catch myself and remember that</i>

703
01:23:40,391 --> 01:23:42,769
<i>these are not the parents
he grew up with,</i>

704
01:23:44,062 --> 01:23:48,691
<i>but people softened by the forced
reflection that comes with loss.</i>

705
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:58,368
<i>Still, everything Chris is saying
has to be said.</i>

706
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:03,998
<i>And I trust for him that
everything he is doing has to be done.</i>

707
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:07,418
<i>This is our life.</i>

708
01:25:15,111 --> 01:25:18,740
Big game. Very big game.

709
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:20,366
Got it.

710
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,687
Damn it!

711
01:27:17,024 --> 01:27:18,359
Get off!

712
01:28:01,277 --> 01:28:04,697
"Hey, Dad, can I light the barbeque,
please, Dad, this time?"

713
01:28:05,323 --> 01:28:06,783
"Well, Son,
you can go get the lighter fluid."

714
01:28:06,866 --> 01:28:09,368
"Come on, Dad. Please, Dad, please?"

715
01:28:10,036 --> 01:28:12,622
"Well, why not, Walt?
That sounds like a good idea..."

716
01:28:12,705 --> 01:28:14,624
"Shut up, Carine! Shut up, Carine!

722
01:28:47,198 --> 01:28:48,407
Shit.

723
01:28:54,455 --> 01:28:59,210
No! No! Damn it!

724
01:29:02,088 --> 01:29:04,757

Hey, Sunni! Come here, baby.

731
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:41,145
No. No!

732
01:31:14,762 --> 01:31:18,099
But now all I'm focused on
is just Alaska.

733
01:31:18,182 --> 01:31:19,767
- Yeah.
- Alaska.

734
01:31:21,727 --> 01:31:24,730
<i>All right. Let's hear it for Insane Cain!</i>

<i>Let's give it up
for Slab City's own Tracy T!</i>

<i>Hey. My name's Tracy.</i>

737
01:31:42,039 --> 01:31:43,833
- Tracy!
- Yeah!

738
01:32:13,904 --> 01:32:16,532
Jack London is king.

739
01:32:17,658 --> 01:32:19,785
Hey, you gonna stay with us long?

740
01:32:20,578 --> 01:32:22,747
Well, I'm waiting on a check
from my last job

741
01:32:22,830 --> 01:32:25,207
to come into Salton City
the day after Christmas.

742
01:32:25,291 --> 01:32:28,085
I've got to start thinking about
getting ready for Alaska.

743
01:32:28,169 --> 01:32:32,757
When the sun gets a little lower tonight,
I'm going to start a calisthenics routine.

744
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:35,843
After the check comes in,
I think I'm gonna try to find

745
01:32:35,926 --> 01:32:39,221
some big old mountains I can climb
every day until spring comes.

746
01:32:39,305 --> 01:32:41,474
I've got to see
how far the money's gonna go.

747
01:32:41,557 --> 01:32:45,144
I've still got a lot of supplies
to pick up before spring.

748
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:50,524
So, I might get another job
or I might be okay.

749
01:32:51,067 --> 01:32:55,237
Hell, we'd give you a little something for
the clays you spend in the booth here.

750
01:32:55,321 --> 01:32:57,823
I'm not taking
any money from you, Rainey.

751
01:32:58,282 --> 01:33:01,202
It's been a real great twist
meeting you two.

752
01:33:01,285 --> 01:33:03,496
You two look like you're doing good.

753
01:33:03,788 --> 01:33:05,748
- We are doing good.
- Yeah?

754
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:07,041
We're doing real good.

755
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:10,753
Speaking of which, don't you think

756
01:33:10,836 --> 01:33:15,174
you ought to introduce yourself
to our little Joni Mitchell over there?

757
01:33:19,595 --> 01:33:20,596
L.-

758
01:33:55,381 --> 01:33:57,967
- Hi.
- Hi.

759
01:34:03,597 --> 01:34:05,558
You selling these books?

760
01:34:05,850 --> 01:34:08,686
I am. We are.

761
01:34:09,937 --> 01:34:11,272
He was.

762
01:34:15,025 --> 01:34:16,569
I like to read.

763
01:34:17,403 --> 01:34:19,905
- Do you?
- Yeah.

764
01:34:20,573 --> 01:34:22,408
That's good.

765
01:34:23,576 --> 01:34:27,288
I heard you play your song last night.

766
01:34:28,497 --> 01:34:33,252
- L'm terrible.
- You are not terrible. You sing sweet.

767
01:34:34,086 --> 01:34:35,421
Thank you.

768
01:34:38,799 --> 01:34:41,969
I was gonna go take a walk
to Salvation Mountain.

769
01:34:42,636 --> 01:34:45,431
- You wanna go?
- Okay.

770
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:56,108
- Hi.
- Hi. Alex.

771
01:34:57,067 --> 01:35:02,823
I'd like to show you around up here.
I've been here since 1984, more or less.

772
01:35:05,618 --> 01:35:07,369
A lot of tourists come in here

773
01:35:07,453 --> 01:35:11,248
and they look at that car door up there.
They really like it.

774
01:35:12,124 --> 01:35:16,128
And I found car doors and put them
up there and I bolted it all in.

775
01:35:16,212 --> 01:35:17,732
Where did you get the telephone poles?

776
01:35:17,796 --> 01:35:20,633
A lot of people in the valley
just love me a lot.

777
01:35:20,758 --> 01:35:23,302
Everybody now, I think,
in the whole world is just loving me.

778
01:35:23,385 --> 01:35:26,639
And I want to have the wisdom
to love them back.

779
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:30,267
And that's about it.
So I really get excited.

780
01:35:30,351 --> 01:35:32,061
You really believe in love, then.

781
01:35:32,144 --> 01:35:34,480
Yeah. Totally.

782
01:35:35,147 --> 01:35:40,069
This is a love story that is staggering
to everybody in the whole world.

783
01:35:40,152 --> 01:35:42,988
That God really loves us a lot.

784
01:35:44,031 --> 01:35:45,532
Does that answer that?

785
01:35:45,616 --> 01:35:47,243
- Yeah.
- Good.

786
01:35:49,203 --> 01:35:53,457
I really love it here. I think the freedom
of this place is just so beautiful.

787
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:57,503
To me, I wouldn't move for $1 O million,
unless I had to.

788
01:35:59,296 --> 01:36:03,008
So I'm contented here in the desert,
and I'm living where I want to live.

789
01:36:03,217 --> 01:36:08,764
And I think good gets better.
And I think those great big tanks there

790
01:36:08,847 --> 01:36:12,476
were the sewer plant for
the Marine base in World War ll.

791
01:36:15,062 --> 01:36:17,773
If you want to,
you can try putting your hands in there.

792
01:36:17,856 --> 01:36:21,026
And I'm gonna do the same thing,
just for the fun.

793
01:36:21,694 --> 01:36:23,612
You're doing real good.

794
01:36:27,032 --> 01:36:30,369
You can wipe your hands off on my shirt
if you want.

795
01:36:50,723 --> 01:36:53,225
This is starting to make me hungry.

796
01:36:54,018 --> 01:36:58,063
I was just a couple of years older
than Tracy when I got pregnant.

797
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:03,527
- Wow.
- Yeah.

798
01:37:05,321 --> 01:37:09,450
Yeah, I thought my husband and I were
going to just make peace on Earth

799
01:37:10,242 --> 01:37:13,037
and babies and love
and stay together forever,

800
01:37:15,581 --> 01:37:18,417
and that didn't quite work out that way.

801
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:21,086
He left me.

802
01:37:25,257 --> 01:37:26,967
So, I...

803
01:37:28,927 --> 01:37:29,970
Anyway, whatever,

804
01:37:30,054 --> 01:37:35,100
but I ended up raising Reno on my own.
That's my boy, his name's Reno.

805
01:37:36,727 --> 01:37:38,437
Then I met Rainey.

806
01:37:39,605 --> 01:37:42,649
That was sweet. It was really
good for a while. It's just...

807
01:37:47,696 --> 01:37:52,326
You know, Reno was
a teenager already by then,

808
01:37:52,451 --> 01:37:55,621
and he was just on his way
to becoming his own man.

809
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:05,756
And I haven't even heard from him
in two years.

810
01:38:09,468 --> 01:38:11,720
I don't even know where he is.

811
01:38:12,262 --> 01:38:14,681
I hope I get to meet him sometime.

812
01:38:17,101 --> 01:38:19,478
Do your folks know where you are?

813
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:27,486
Hey, guys?
Dinner's ready if you guys are hungry.

814
01:38:27,569 --> 01:38:31,323
Yeah, we are. We're hungry.

815
01:38:34,868 --> 01:38:36,495
I'll be all right.

816
01:38:47,339 --> 01:38:49,049
You want to come and eat?

817
01:38:49,633 --> 01:38:53,053
Or we'll sit here.
Because I will sit here with you all night.

818
01:38:58,308 --> 01:38:59,852
Let's go. Let's go.

819
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:04,565
Guys, come on. It's getting cold.

820
01:39:08,193 --> 01:39:13,365
Check this out. Tawdry?
Denise, that sounds like your cup of tea.

821
01:39:43,145 --> 01:39:47,149
That poor girl is about ready
to vault herself onto a fence post.

822
01:39:47,983 --> 01:39:52,321
And here you are,
the monk of Jack fucking LaLanne.

823
01:39:59,203 --> 01:40:03,248
- So Jan talked to you about Reno, huh?
- Yeah.

824
01:40:06,251 --> 01:40:09,963
Children can be pretty harsh
when it comes to their parents.

825
01:40:10,506 --> 01:40:12,716
You planning on seeing yours?

826
01:40:14,968 --> 01:40:17,304
I've only got one plan, Rainey.

827
01:40:18,388 --> 01:40:21,058
That would be Alaska?

828
01:40:21,266 --> 01:40:22,684
Alaska.

829
01:40:34,196 --> 01:40:35,364
Hello?

830
01:40:37,032 --> 01:40:40,077
- Merry Christmas.
- Come in here.

831
01:40:49,211 --> 01:40:51,296
My parents went into town.

832
01:40:52,965 --> 01:40:53,966
No.

833
01:40:54,299 --> 01:40:57,469
Yeah. They went to call my grandma
for Christmas.

834
01:40:58,136 --> 01:41:00,305
No, I mean we can't do that.

835
01:41:01,515 --> 01:41:02,766
Why not?

836
01:41:09,982 --> 01:41:11,567
How old are you?

837
01:41:12,484 --> 01:41:13,777
Eighteen.

838
01:41:16,863 --> 01:41:18,365
Seventeen.

839
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:22,160
What year were you born?

840
01:41:29,001 --> 01:41:30,669
So I'm 16.

841
01:41:44,766 --> 01:41:47,185
You want to do something together?

842
01:43:01,176 --> 01:43:05,847
You can send mail to this address
in South Dakota.

843
01:43:07,474 --> 01:43:11,853
I don't know when I'm going to get it,
but I'll get it.

844
01:43:16,149 --> 01:43:17,943
You're pretty magic.

845
01:43:18,026 --> 01:43:20,696
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

846
01:43:22,614 --> 01:43:24,282
And just remember

847
01:43:24,658 --> 01:43:29,162
if you want something in life,
reach out and grab it.

848
01:43:50,475 --> 01:43:52,519
- You take care, kiddo.
- You, too.

849
01:43:54,813 --> 01:43:57,899
- New Year's resolution?
- We'll work on it.

850
01:45:05,717 --> 01:45:08,553
Just get your pack
and get on out of here, okay?

851
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:12,057
I don't think I could take a hug.

852
01:45:26,738 --> 01:45:27,739
Hey.

853
01:45:40,335 --> 01:45:41,419
Bye!

854
01:45:56,268 --> 01:46:00,856
<i>A year and a half had passed in what
Dad called "suspended animation."</i>

855
01:46:08,321 --> 01:46:14,286
<i>The weight of Chris' disappearance had

886
01:52:06,679 --> 01:52:08,348
Where's your camp?

887
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:11,684
Just out past Oh-My-God Hot Springs.

888
01:52:12,477 --> 01:52:15,605
I've lived in and around here
for six years now

889
01:52:16,147 --> 01:52:18,233
and I've never heard of any place
that goes by that name.

890
01:52:18,316 --> 01:52:21,277
- Show me how to get there.
- Yeah.

891
01:52:24,906 --> 01:52:27,533
- Ron Franz.
- Alex.

892
01:52:27,659 --> 01:52:29,494
Alex? Where you from, Alex?

893
01:52:30,411 --> 01:52:34,415
- West Virginia.
- Okay, Alex from West Virginia.

894
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:24,215
Well, this is something out here.

895
01:53:29,095 --> 01:53:30,346
Don't you...

896
01:53:31,347 --> 01:53:36,060
Don't you worry about those dope
smokers and nudists down below there?

897
01:53:36,144 --> 01:53:39,981
No, they keep to themselves
pretty much.

898
01:53:40,064 --> 01:53:43,359
You strike me as a bright young man.
Am I wrong about that?

899
01:53:44,569 --> 01:53:46,988
I think I've got
my head on my shoulders pretty good.

900
01:53:47,071 --> 01:53:48,823
Well, that's what I mean.

901
01:53:53,494 --> 01:53:55,580
How long you been out here?

902
01:53:57,206 --> 01:54:00,418
- Couple of weeks.
- And before that?

903
01:54:00,918 --> 01:54:04,088
A lot of places.
Been moving around a lot.

904
01:54:05,214 --> 01:54:08,426
- Well, how old are you?
- Twenty-three.

905
01:54:09,344 --> 01:54:10,595
Twenty-three years old!

906
01:54:10,678 --> 01:54:13,681
Son, don't you think
you ought to be getting an education?

907
01:54:13,765 --> 01:54:16,768
And a job?
And making something of this life?

908
01:54:19,979 --> 01:54:21,606
Look, Mr. Franz,

909
01:54:22,774 --> 01:54:26,652
I think careers are a 20th century
invention, and I don't want one.

910
01:54:27,612 --> 01:54:31,449
You don't need to worry about me.
I have a college education.

911
01:54:31,699 --> 01:54:35,870
I'm not destitute.
I'm living like this by choice.

912
01:54:37,538 --> 01:54:41,918
- In the dirt?
- Yeah, in the dirt.

913
01:54:46,214 --> 01:54:49,926
- Where's your family?
- Don't have one anymore.

914
01:54:53,304 --> 01:54:54,806
That's a shame.

915
01:54:58,142 --> 01:55:00,853
Hey, Mr. Franz,
I want to show you something.

916
01:55:01,604 --> 01:55:02,814
Come on.

917
01:55:05,483 --> 01:55:06,692
Come on.

918
01:55:32,343 --> 01:55:37,723
It's getting a little steep.
A little high for me, kid.

919
01:55:39,183 --> 01:55:40,726
All right,

920
01:55:42,019 --> 01:55:45,314
but even from halfway out,
it's quite a sight, isn't it?

921
01:55:47,358 --> 01:55:52,196
From the top, you can see all the way
to the Salton Sea, too.

922
01:55:52,864 --> 01:55:55,283
You can see the Salton Sea
from up there?

923
01:55:55,575 --> 01:55:56,868
Yes, sir.

924
01:55:57,660 --> 01:55:59,036
My goodness.

925
01:56:00,121 --> 01:56:04,959
- You don't want to go up?
- Nope. I don't do these kind of things.

926
01:56:08,546 --> 01:56:10,965
I spent most of my life in the Army.

927
01:56:13,801 --> 01:56:18,556
New Year's Eve, 1957,
I was stationed in Okinawa.

928
01:56:20,057 --> 01:56:24,061
My wife and son were here in the States
just driving down the road,

929
01:56:24,145 --> 01:56:27,690
and some fella who'd had too much
to drink plowed right into them.

930
01:56:28,232 --> 01:56:30,234
Killed them both.

931
01:56:34,614 --> 01:56:39,744
Now you might think
the last thing I would do in the world

932
01:56:42,580 --> 01:56:44,373
is go to the whiskey.

933
01:56:46,083 --> 01:56:50,296
But at the time,
it felt like the only thing I could do.

934
01:56:50,379 --> 01:56:53,007
And I did it hard!

935
01:56:56,010 --> 01:56:58,513
But pretty soon I realized

936
01:56:59,263 --> 01:57:03,518
I wasn't doing my wife and son any good
mourning them with the bottle.

937
01:57:03,893 --> 01:57:07,939
So I pulled myself together
and I quit drinking,

938
01:57:08,606 --> 01:57:09,982
cold turkey.

939
01:57:11,275 --> 01:57:15,655
So since all that, this is pretty much me.

940
01:57:16,948 --> 01:57:19,200
Do you ever travel, Mr. Franz?

941
01:57:20,243 --> 01:57:23,329
No, I can't seem to get too far
from my leather.

942
01:57:25,039 --> 01:57:29,627
I do a lot of leather engraving.
I got a little workshop out in the garage.

943
01:57:29,961 --> 01:57:32,171
Between that and my pension,
I do pretty well.

944
01:57:32,255 --> 01:57:34,799
But every time I think
I might take a trip somewhere,

945
01:57:34,882 --> 01:57:38,511
I get too far behind on orders and such
to consider it.

946
01:57:39,387 --> 01:57:42,056
When we finish eating,
I'd love to see your workshop.

947
01:57:42,139 --> 01:57:43,558
- Would you?
- Oh, yeah.

948
01:57:43,641 --> 01:57:45,434
I was hoping you'd say that.

949
01:57:45,518 --> 01:57:48,479
- It's amazing how malleable this is.
- Yeah, it is.

950
01:57:48,563 --> 01:57:50,273
When the leather is wet you can really...

951
01:57:50,356 --> 01:57:51,691
- lt's like butter.
- Yeah.

952
01:57:51,774 --> 01:57:55,319
It's amazing. And then it hardens up,
and, I mean, it stays right there.

953
01:58:40,364 --> 01:58:46,037
A good whack with the mallet.
Crack it down. Whack. Bang.

954
01:59:46,389 --> 01:59:50,059
I went to South Dakota.
I worked at a grain elevator

955
01:59:50,142 --> 01:59:52,687
for this guy named Wayne.
He was a really good guy.

956
01:59:52,770 --> 01:59:54,355
So I took the Colorado River

957
01:59:54,438 --> 01:59:57,733
all the way down through
the Grand Canyon and did rapids,

958
01:59:57,817 --> 02:00:01,445
which is by far one of
the scariest things I've ever done.

959
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:06,951
And I took the Colorado down into
Mexico, Golfo, where I got stuck.

960
02:00:07,827 --> 02:00:10,162
Salvation Mountain. The Slabs.

961
02:00:11,872 --> 02:00:13,999
What's the "N" stand for?

962
02:00:15,626 --> 02:00:16,794
North.

963
02:00:18,087 --> 02:00:19,755
Alaska?

964
02:00:22,758 --> 02:00:25,261
Son, what the hell
are you running from?

965
02:00:26,387 --> 02:00:28,848
You know, I can ask you
the same question!

966
02:00:29,890 --> 02:00:32,309
Except I already know the answer!

967
02:00:33,144 --> 02:00:34,645
You do, do you?

968
02:00:35,396 --> 02:00:39,650
I do, Mr. Franz!
You got to get back out in the world!

969
02:00:40,443 --> 02:00:43,654
Get out of that lonely house,
that little workshop of yours.

970
02:00:43,738 --> 02:00:47,783
Get back out on the road! Really!

971
02:00:48,659 --> 02:00:51,287
You're going to live a long time, Ron!

972
02:00:51,370 --> 02:00:54,665
You should make a radical change
in your lifestyle!

973
02:00:55,332 --> 02:00:59,253
I mean, the core of man's spirit
comes from new experiences.

974
02:00:59,795 --> 02:01:04,008
And there you are, stubborn old man,
sitting on your butt.

975
02:01:05,134 --> 02:01:07,970
- Sitting on my butt?
- Yeah.

976
02:01:09,513 --> 02:01:13,934
I'll show you sitting on my butt!

977
02:01:14,018 --> 02:01:16,061
"Stubborn old man."

978
02:01:17,521 --> 02:01:19,190
I'll show you!

979
02:01:19,690 --> 02:01:21,901
Come on, then! Come on.

980
02:01:24,862 --> 02:01:27,990
Sitting on my butt? Yeah.

981
02:01:30,075 --> 02:01:32,244
Come on, old man. Come climbing.

982
02:01:32,328 --> 02:01:34,038
Sitting on my butt.

983
02:01:34,371 --> 02:01:35,873
Come on. Keep going!

984
02:01:39,710 --> 02:01:41,420
You're doing great!

985
02:01:46,217 --> 02:01:48,886
- Keep going. Keep going, Ron!
- Yeah!

986
02:01:50,638 --> 02:01:54,391
Can anybody see this?
God, are you watching this right now?

987
02:02:02,566 --> 02:02:03,692
Yeah.

988
02:02:06,737 --> 02:02:11,075
- You all right?
- You little pinhead!

989
02:02:28,592 --> 02:02:30,928
I'm gonna miss you when you go.

990
02:02:32,555 --> 02:02:36,225
I'll miss you, too, Ron.
But you're wrong if you think

991
02:02:36,308 --> 02:02:40,271
that the joy of life comes principally
from human relationships.

992
02:02:41,272 --> 02:02:43,607
God's placed it all around us.
It's in everything.

993
02:02:43,691 --> 02:02:46,068
It's in anything we can experience.

994
02:02:46,944 --> 02:02:50,447
People just need to change the way
they look at those things.

995
02:02:50,531 --> 02:02:52,741
Yeah, I'm gonna take stock of that.

996
02:02:54,618 --> 02:02:55,911
No, lam.

997
02:03:00,124 --> 02:03:01,208
Lam.

998
02:03:03,586 --> 02:03:05,796
But I wanted to tell you something.

999
02:03:09,550 --> 02:03:12,303
From the bits and pieces I put together,

1000
02:03:12,386 --> 02:03:16,473
you know, from what you told me about
your family, your mother and your dad.

1001
02:03:18,475 --> 02:03:21,812
And I know you've got your problems
with the church, too.

1002
02:03:23,731 --> 02:03:27,484
But there's some kind of bigger thing
we can all appreciate,

1003
02:03:28,485 --> 02:03:31,697
and it sounds like
you don't mind calling it God.

1004
02:03:37,786 --> 02:03:40,706
But when you forgive,

1005
02:03:42,958 --> 02:03:44,209
you love.

1006
02:03:47,963 --> 02:03:51,008
And when you love,

1007
02:03:51,842 --> 02:03:54,428
God's light shines on you.

1008
02:03:59,141 --> 02:04:02,853
- Holy shit.
- I told you about that language.

1009
02:04:13,030 --> 02:04:14,531
I told you so!

1010
02:04:17,409 --> 02:04:20,955
Where are the fucking animals now?
I'm hungry!

1011
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:25,292
I'm fucking hungry! I'm fucking hungry!

1012
02:04:42,351 --> 02:04:46,105
<i>"For a moment she rediscovered
the purpose of her life.</i>

1013
02:04:46,981 --> 02:04:50,693

What is this? What is this one?

02:05:04,748 --> 02:05:09,712
<i>This is Viburnum edule.

<i>Hedysarum alpinum.</i>

1019
02:05:19,638 --> 02:05:24,351
Hedysarum alpinum is wild potato root.
Wild potato root.

Fuck it all. Fuck it all!

1022
02:11:06,985 --> 02:11:08,028
Hi.

1023
02:11:08,111 --> 02:11:11,281
What are you doing up?
It's 3:30 in the morning.

1024
02:11:11,615 --> 02:11:14,826
I heard you get off the couch
about a half hour ago.

1025
02:11:16,119 --> 02:11:19,831
Had a funny feeling
you might not be here for our breakfast.

1026
02:11:24,044 --> 02:11:28,965
I'm gonna drive you 100 miles to
someplace where you can catch a train,

1027
02:11:29,716 --> 02:11:34,429
a plane or hitch a ride
and not get stuck out in this desert.

1028
02:11:35,639 --> 02:11:39,643
I'd take you all the way to Alaska
if I didn't have an 8:00 mass.

1029
02:11:39,976 --> 02:11:43,397
- Ron, you don't have to do that.
- I want to do it.

1030
02:11:44,272 --> 02:11:47,275
Get you started on this thing of yours.

1031
02:11:47,734 --> 02:11:49,778
- On my great...
- I know.

1032
02:11:50,445 --> 02:11:52,989
On your great Alaskan adventure.

1033
02:11:53,782 --> 02:11:56,493
Here. Here's a machete.

1034
02:11:58,829 --> 02:12:03,667
Collapsible fishing pole, a few other
odds and ends I stuck in there for you.

1035
02:12:07,129 --> 02:12:09,548
- Ron...
- Just take it.

1036
02:12:10,924 --> 02:12:13,760
I'll get dressed
and meet you in the truck.

1037
02:13:10,025 --> 02:13:11,651
Well, my friend.

1038
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:15,197
Yep.

1039
02:13:19,576 --> 02:13:22,078
I had an idea.

1040
02:13:23,205 --> 02:13:27,876
You know, my mother was an only child

1041
02:13:28,752 --> 02:13:30,587
and so was my father,

1042
02:13:31,213 --> 02:13:35,509
and I was their only child,

1043
02:13:38,887 --> 02:13:41,598
so when I'm gone,
I'm the end of the line.

1044
02:13:42,641 --> 02:13:44,768
My family will be finished.

1045
02:13:48,438 --> 02:13:53,777
What do you say you let me adopt you?

1046
02:13:58,114 --> 02:14:02,244
I can be, say, your grandfather.

1047
02:14:06,623 --> 02:14:08,250
Ron,

1048
02:14:09,834 --> 02:14:13,630
could we talk about this
when I get back from Alaska?

1049
02:14:14,005 --> 02:14:15,799
Would that be okay?

1050
02:14:23,098 --> 02:14:26,309
Yeah, yeah. We can do that. Yeah.

1051
02:14:31,273 --> 02:14:32,607
All right, Ron.

1052
02:14:34,985 --> 02:14:36,319
Thank you.

1053
02:15:25,452 --> 02:15:27,662
<i>What did his voice sound like now?</i>

1054

1055
