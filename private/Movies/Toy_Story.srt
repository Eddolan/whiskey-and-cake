1
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,944
All right, everyone!
This... is a stick-up!

2
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,654
Don't anybody move!

3
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,782
Now, empty that safe!

4
00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:11,954
Money, money, money!

5
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,331
Stop it! Stop it,
you mean, old potato!

6
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:17,460
Quiet, Bo Peep,
or your sheep get run over!

7
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:19,670
Help! Baa!
Help us!

8
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:23,257
Oh, no, not my sheep!
Somebody do something!

9
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:32,725
Reach for the sky!

10
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:35,019
Oh, no! Sheriff Woody!

11
00:01:35,103 --> 00:01:37,521
I'm here to stop you,
One-Eyed Bart.

12
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,274
How'd you know it was me?

13
00:01:40,358 --> 00:01:42,068
Are you gonna come quietly?

14
00:01:42,152 --> 00:01:43,360
You can't touch me, Sheriff!

15
00:01:43,445 --> 00:01:46,739
I brought my attack dog
with the built-in force field.

16
00:01:46,823 --> 00:01:50,785
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

17
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,997
Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!
You're going to jail, Bart!

18
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,917
Say goodbye to the wife
and Tater Tots.

19
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:08,803
You saved the day again, Woody.

20
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:11,430
You're my favourite deputy.

21
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:14,016
You've got a friend in me

22
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,020
You've got a friend in me

23
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,897
Come on,
let's wrangle up the cattle.

24
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:23,067
When the road looks rough ahead

25
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:26,987
And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed

26
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:28,280
Round 'em up, cowboy!

27
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:31,158
Just remember
what your old pal said

28
00:02:31,243 --> 00:02:33,994
Boy, you've got a friend in me

29
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:35,287
Yee-haw!

30
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:38,249
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

31
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,959
Hey, cowboy!

32
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:43,879
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

33
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:46,006
Big and stronger too

34
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:47,174
Come on, Woody.

35
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:48,342
Maybe

36
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:53,138
But none of them will ever
love you the way I do

37
00:02:53,557 --> 00:02:56,058
It's me and you, boy

38
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,518
And as the years go by

39
00:02:57,602 --> 00:02:59,395
Whoa! Whoa!

40
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,064
Our friendship will never die

41
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,528
You're gonna see
It's our destiny

42
00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:10,990
You've got a friend in me

43
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:12,241
All right!

44
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,702
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

45
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:16,203
Score!

46
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,497
You got a friend in me

47
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:19,623
Wow! Cool!

48
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,960
-What do you think?
-Oh, this looks great, Mom!

49
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:24,336
Okay, birthday boy...

50
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:26,463
We saw that at the store!
I asked you for it!

51
00:03:26,548 --> 00:03:28,632
-I hope I have enough places.
-Wow, look at that! That's so...

52
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:30,301
-One, two... Four.
-Oh, my gosh, you got...

53
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:33,095
-Yeah, I think that's gonna be enough.
-Could we leave this up 'til we move?

54
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,097
-Well, sure! We can leave it up.
-Yeah!

55
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,224
Now go get Molly. Your friends
are gonna be here any minute.

56
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:40,144
Okay. It's party? time, Woody.

57
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:43,564
Yee-haw!

58
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:51,238
Howdy, little lady.

59
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,578
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

60
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,246
Come on, Molly.

61
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:00,456
Oh, you're getting heavy.

62
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,541
See you later, Woody.

63
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:13,677
Pull my string!
The birthday party's today?

64
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,680
Okay, everybody,

65
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:18,140
coast is clear!

66
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,858
Ages 3 and up. It's on my box.

67
00:04:27,943 --> 00:04:31,862
Ages 3 and up. I'm not supposed
to be baby-sitting Princess Drool.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Hey, Hamm.

69
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:48,212
-Look, I'm Picasso!
-I don't get it.

70
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:52,841
You uncultured swine! What're
you lookin' at, ya hockey puck?

71
00:04:57,222 --> 00:05:00,015
-Hey, Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
-Sir! No, sir!

72
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,018
Okay. Hey, thank you. At ease.

73
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,729
Hey, uh, Slinky?

74
00:05:05,814 --> 00:05:08,649
Right here, Woody.
I'm red this time.

75
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,943
-No. Slink...
-Oh, well, all right.

76
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:12,194
You can be red if you want.

77
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:15,364
-Not now, Slink. I got some bad news.
-Bad news?

78
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:19,702
Just gather everyone up
for a staff meeting, and be happy.

79
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,786
Got it.

80
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,204
Be happy!

81
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,958
Staff meeting, everybody!
Snake, Robot, podium duty.

82
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:27,960
Hey.

83
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,881
Hey, Etch. Draw!

84
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:37,052
Oh! Got me again.

85
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:40,806
Etch, you've been working on that draw.
Fastest knobs in the West.

86
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,892
Got a staff meeting, you guys.
Come on, let's go.

87
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:46,603
Now, where is that... Oh.

88
00:05:46,688 --> 00:05:49,231
Hey, who moved my doodle pad
way over here?

89
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:54,862
-How're you doin', Rex?
-Were you scared? Tell me honestly.

90
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:56,822
I was close to being scared
that time.

91
00:05:56,906 --> 00:06:00,492
I'm going for fearsome here,
but I just don't feel it.

92
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,870
I think I'm just
coming off as annoying.

93
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:06,498
Oh, hi, Bo. Hi.

94
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,168
I wanted to thank you, Woody,
for saving my flock.

95
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:12,004
Oh, hey, it was, uh, nothin'.

96
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:16,383
What do you say I get someone else
to watch the sheep tonight?

97
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:18,594
Oh, yeah!

98
00:06:19,763 --> 00:06:24,016
Remember, I'm just
a couple of blocks away.

99
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,893
-Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!
-Come on, come on.

100
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:27,269
Smaller toys up front.

101
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:31,190
Hey, Woody, come on.

102
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:38,697
Oh, thanks, Mike.

103
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,866
Okay... Whoa, whoa. Step back.

104
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,452
-For crying out loud.
-Thank you.

105
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:47,873
Hello? Check.
That better? Great.

106
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:50,959
Everybody hear me? Up on the shelf,
can you hear me? Great.

107
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:54,129
Okay. First item today...

108
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:57,549
Oh, yeah.
Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

109
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:00,219
-What?
-Moving buddy? You can't be serious.

110
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:02,513
I didn't know we were
supposed to have one already.

111
00:07:02,597 --> 00:07:04,973
Do we have to hold hands?

112
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,309
You guys think this is a big joke.

113
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,812
We've only got one week
left before the move.

114
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,898
I don't want any toys left behind.
A moving buddy.

115
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:15,526
If you don't have one, get one!

116
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,570
All right, next. Oh, yes.

117
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:21,949
Tuesday night's plastic corrosion
awareness meeting

118
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:24,409
was, I think, a big success.

119
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:27,663
And we wanna thank Mr Spell
for putting that on for us.

120
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,374
-Thank you, Mr Spell.
-You're welcome.

121
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,877
Okay. Oh, yes.
One minor note here.

122
00:07:33,962 --> 00:07:36,588
Andy's birthday party
has been moved to today.

123
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:38,382
Wait a minute here!

124
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:41,593
What do you mean the party's today?
His birthday's not 'til next week!

125
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:44,304
What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losin' her marbles?

126
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:48,100
Well, obviously she wanted to
have the party before the move.

127
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:49,935
I'm not worried.
You shouldn't be worried.

128
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:51,478
Of course Woody ain't worried.

129
00:07:51,563 --> 00:07:53,605
He's been Andy's favourite
since kindergarten.

130
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,983
Hey, hey.
Come on, Potato Head.

131
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:59,611
If Woody says it's all right, then,
well, darn it, it's good enough for me.

132
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:01,905
Woody has never
steered us wrong before.

133
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,617
Come on, guys. Every Christmas
and birthday we go through this.

134
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:08,704
But what if Andy gets
another dinosaur, a mean one?

135
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,790
I just don't think I could take
that kind of rejection!

136
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,168
Hey, listen,
no one's getting replaced.

137
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:17,171
This is Andy
we're talking about.

138
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:20,340
It doesn't matter
how much we're played with.

139
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:26,638
What matters is that we're here
for Andy when he needs us.

140
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:28,765
That's what we're made for, right?

141
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,603
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff
meeting, but... they're here!

142
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:34,438
Birthday guests at three o'clock!

143
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:36,648
Stay calm, everyone!

144
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:38,192
Hey!

145
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:41,236
Meeting adjourned.

146
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,739
Ho, boy! Will you take a look
at all those presents?

147
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:46,241
I can't see a thing.

148
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,456
Yes, sir, we're next month's
garage sale fodder for sure.

149
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,375
-Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
-Oh, for crying out loud.

150
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,587
-They're all in boxes, you idiot.
-They're getting bigger.

151
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,964
Wait, there's a nice
little one over there.

152
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:02,090
Hi!

153
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,262
-Spell, trash can.
-We're doomed!

154
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,097
All right! All right!

155
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:12,851
If I send out the troops,
will you all calm down?

156
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:16,772
-Yes! Yes! We promise!
-Okay! Save your batteries.

157
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,857
Very good, Woody.
That's using the old noodle.

158
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:25,447
Sergeant, establish
a recon post downstairs. Code Red!

159
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,991
-You know what to do.
-Yes, sir!

160
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,911
All right, men.
You heard him. Code Red!

161
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:34,373
Repeat, we are at Code Red.
Recon plan Charlie. Execute!

162
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:36,583
Let's move!
Move, move, move, move!

163
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:56,603
Yeah!

164
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:00,816
Okay, come on, kids.

165
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,819
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.

166
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,592
All right, gangway, gangway.

167
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:30,887
And this is how we find out

168
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:33,181
what is in those presents.

169
00:10:36,978 --> 00:10:39,896
Okay, who's hungry?

170
00:10:40,732 --> 00:10:41,940
Here come the chips!

171
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:44,484
I've got Cool Ranch
and barbecue!

172
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:46,528
What in the world... Oh!

173
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:50,032
I thought I told him
to pick these up.

174
00:10:50,325 --> 00:10:52,743
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?

175
00:10:52,827 --> 00:10:55,912
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.

176
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,957
Come on!
They're not lying down on the job.

177
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,137
Go on without me!
Just go!

178
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:15,057
A good soldier never
leaves a man behind.

179
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:34,951
Okay, everybody, come on.

180
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:37,996
Everybody settle down.
Now, kids. Everybody...

181
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:41,833
You sit in a circle. No, Andy.
Andy, you sit in the middle there.

182
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:45,962
Good. And... Which present
are you gonna open first?

183
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,091
-Mine!
-There they are.

184
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,885
Come in, Mother Bird.
This is Alpha Bravo.

185
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:54,221
-This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet!
-Come in, Mother Bird.

186
00:11:54,305 --> 00:11:57,432
All right, Andy's opening
the first present now.

187
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,352
Mrs Potato Head! Mrs Potato Head!
Mrs Potato Head!

188
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,896
Hey, I can dream, can't I?

189
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,482
The bow's coming off.
He's ripping the wrapping paper.

190
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:08,068
It's a... It's...
It's a... a lunch box.

191
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:10,362
-We've got a lunch box here.
-A lunch box?

192
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:12,239
-Lunch box?
-For lunch.

193
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:14,825
Okay, second present.
It appears to be...

194
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:17,786
-Okay, it's bed sheets.
-Who invited that kid?

195
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,127
Oh! Only one left.

196
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:27,921
-Okay, we're on the last present now.
-Last present!

197
00:12:28,005 --> 00:12:30,382
It's a big one. It's a...

198
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:33,009
-It's a board game! Repeat, Battleship!
-Whew!

199
00:12:33,094 --> 00:12:35,303
Hallelujah!

200
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,264
-Yeah! All right!
-Hey, watch it!

201
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:39,099
Sorry there, old spud head.

202
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:42,936
Mission accomplished. Well done, men.
Pack it up. We're goin' home.

203
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,355
So did I tell ya?
Nothin' to worry about.

204
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,859
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted ya for a second.

205
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,236
Wait a minute. Oh!

206
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,407
-What do we have here?
-Wait! Turn that thing back on!

207
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:57,284
Come in, Mother Bird!
Come in, Mother Bird!

208
00:12:57,368 --> 00:13:00,078
Mom has pulled a surprise
present from the closet.

209
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:02,581
Andy's opening it.
He's really excited about this one.

210
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:04,583
-Mom, what is it?
-It's a huge package.

211
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:07,627
Oh, get outta the... One of the kids
is in the way. I can't see.

212
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:10,672
-It's a...
-Wow!

213
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:15,177
It's a what? What is it?

214
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,096
-Oh, no!
-Oh, ya big lizard!

215
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:20,807
-Now we'll never know what it is!
-Way to go, Rex!

216
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:22,851
No, no! Turn 'em around!
Turn 'em around!

217
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,437
He's puttin' 'em in backwa...
Here, you're puttin' 'em in backwards!

218
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:28,648
Plus is positive, minus is negative!
Oh, let me!

219
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,152
Let's go to my room, guys!

220
00:13:32,236 --> 00:13:35,071
Red alert! Red alert!
Andy is coming upstairs!

221
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,115
-There!
-Juvenile intrusion!

222
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,992
Repeat, resume
your positions now!

223
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:41,745
Andy's coming! Everybody,
back to your places! Hurry!

224
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:43,830
Get to your places!
Get to your places!

225
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:46,249
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?

226
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:49,377
Out of my way! Here I come!
Here I come!

227
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:03,308
Hey, look, its lasers light up.
Take that, Zurg!

228
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:06,686
Quick, make a space.
This is where the spaceship lands.

229
00:14:06,771 --> 00:14:08,939
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!

230
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:11,942
Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!

231
00:14:12,026 --> 00:14:14,069
We've got prizes!

232
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:26,831
-What is it?
-Can you see it?

233
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:31,253
-What the heck is up there?
-Woody, who's up there with ya?

234
00:14:33,548 --> 00:14:34,506
Woody?

235
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,509
-What are you doing under the bed?
-Nothin'. Nothin'.

236
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:40,220
I'm sure Andy was just
a little excited, that's all.

237
00:14:40,304 --> 00:14:43,056
Too much cake and ice cream,
I suppose. It's just a mistake!

238
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,935
Well, that mistake is sitting
in your spot, Woody.

239
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,188
-Have you been replaced?
-What did I tell you earlier?

240
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:52,107
No one is getting replaced.

241
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,902
Now, let's all be polite and give
whatever it is up there

242
00:14:55,987 --> 00:14:59,656
a nice, big
Andy's-room welcome.

243
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:26,433
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

244
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:28,435
Come in, Star Command.

245
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:31,396
Star Command, come in.
Do you read me?

246
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,733
Why don't they answer? My ship!

247
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,822
Blast! This'll take weeks to repair.

248
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,451
Buzz Lightyear mission log,
stardate 4-0-7-2.

249
00:15:44,535 --> 00:15:47,829
My ship has run off course
en route to sector 12.

250
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,415
I've crash-landed
on a strange planet.

251
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:53,001
The impact must've awoken me
from hypersleep.

252
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:57,839
Terrain seems a bit unstable.

253
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,009
No readout yet
if the air is breathable.

254
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:04,179
And there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

255
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,263
Hello!

256
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,600
Whoa! Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

257
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:10,977
Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to.

258
00:16:11,062 --> 00:16:13,480
Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody.

259
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:17,442
And this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.

260
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:20,278
And also, there has been
a bit of a mix-up.

261
00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:22,656
This is my spot, see,
the bed here.

262
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,033
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.

263
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,119
I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger,
Universe Protection Unit.

264
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:30,413
My ship has crash-landed here
by mistake.

265
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:34,292
Yes, it is a mistake because,
you see, the bed here is my spot.

266
00:16:34,377 --> 00:16:35,960
I need to repair
my turbo boosters.

267
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:39,172
Do you people still use fossil fuel, or
have you discovered crystallic fusion?

268
00:16:39,256 --> 00:16:41,216
Well, let's see. We got double-A's.

269
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,677
Watch yourself!
Halt! Who goes there?

270
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:46,137
Don't shoot!
It's okay. Friends.

271
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:49,974
-Do you know these life-forms?
-Yes! They're Andy's toys.

272
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:52,435
All right, everyone,
you're clear to come up.

273
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,146
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.

274
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:58,566
Oh, I'm so glad
you're not a dinosaur!

275
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,819
Wh-why, thank you!

276
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:03,613
Now, thank you all
for your kind welcome!

277
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:06,449
-Say, what's that button do?
-I'll show you.

278
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,160
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

279
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,330
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string.

280
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:14,666
-Only it's...
-Only it sounds like a car ran over it.

281
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,461
Oh, yeah, but not like this.
This is a quality sound system.

282
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:20,088
Probably all copper wiring, huh?

283
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:23,425
So, where you from?
Singapore? Hong Kong?

284
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:27,762
Well, no. Actually, I'm stationed up
in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.

285
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:30,682
As a member of the elite
Universe Protection Unit

286
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:32,183
of the Space Ranger Corps,

287
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:34,978
I protect the galaxy
from the threat of invasion

288
00:17:35,062 --> 00:17:39,149
from the evil Emperor Zurg,
sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

289
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,651
Oh, really?
I'm from Playskool.

290
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,195
And I'm from Mattel.
Well, I'm not really from Mattel.

291
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,822
I'm actually from a smaller company

292
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:48,074
that was purchased
in a leveraged buyout.

293
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:49,951
You'd think they'd never seen
a new toy before.

294
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,703
Well, sure. Look at him.

295
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:54,581
He's got more gadgets on him
than a Swiss Army knife.

296
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,375
Please be careful.

297
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,043
You don't want to be in the way
when my laser goes off.

298
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:02,589
Hey, a laser! How come
you don't have a laser, Woody?

299
00:18:02,673 --> 00:18:05,633
It's not a laser! It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.

300
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,385
-What's with him?
-Laser envy.

301
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,720
All right, that's enough!

302
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:12,223
Look, we're all very impressed
with Andy's new toy.

303
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:14,684
-Toy?
-T-O-Y. Toy!

304
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:18,730
Excuse me, I think the word
you're searching for is "Space Ranger."

305
00:18:18,814 --> 00:18:23,276
The word I'm searching for I can't say
because there's preschool toys present.

306
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,861
Gettin' kinda tense, aren't ya?

307
00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:27,989
Mr Lightyear, now, I'm curious.

308
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,700
What does a Space Ranger
actually do?

309
00:18:30,784 --> 00:18:32,827
He's not a Space Ranger!

310
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:36,581
He doesn't fight evil
or, or shoot lasers or fly!

311
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:38,082
Excuse me.

312
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:42,587
Oh, impressive wingspan!
Very good!

313
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:47,425
Oh, what? What?
These are plastic. He can't fly!

314
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,970
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy,
and I can fly.

315
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:54,349
-No, you can't.
-Yes, I can.

316
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,433
-You can't.
-Can.

317
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:57,227
Can't. Can't. Can't!

318
00:18:57,311 --> 00:18:59,771
I tell you, I could fly around
this room with my eyes closed!

319
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:03,983
-Okay, then, Mr Light Beer, prove it.
-All right, then, I will.

320
00:19:04,068 --> 00:19:06,027
Stand back, everyone!

321
00:19:13,702 --> 00:19:16,454
To infinity and beyond!

322
00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:45,483
-Can!
-Whoa!

323
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:48,778
Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!

324
00:19:48,862 --> 00:19:52,991
-I found my movin' buddy.
-Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.

325
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:56,911
That wasn't flying!
That was... falling with style.

326
00:19:56,996 --> 00:20:00,164
Man, the dolls must really
go for you. Can you teach me that?

327
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,168
-Golly bob howdy!
-Oh, shut up!

328
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:05,253
You know, in a couple of days,

329
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,672
everything will be just the way
it was. They'll see.

330
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:09,424
They'll see.

331
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,885
I'm still Andy's favourite toy.

332
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:16,264
I was on top of the world
livin' high

333
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,349
It was right in my pocket

334
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:22,312
I was livin' the life

335
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:25,773
Things were just the way
they should be

336
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:30,320
When from out of the sky
like a bomb

337
00:20:30,404 --> 00:20:32,697
Comes some little punk
in a rocket

338
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,369
Now all of a sudden some
strange things are happening to me

339
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:40,455
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

340
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:44,834
Strange

341
00:20:44,918 --> 00:20:47,295
Things are happening to me

342
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,800
Strange

343
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:56,054
Things

344
00:20:56,138 --> 00:21:01,351
Strange things are happening to me

345
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,020
Ain't no doubt about it

346
00:21:09,818 --> 00:21:13,446
I had friends
I had lots of friends

347
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,991
Now all my friends are gone

348
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:20,328
And I'm doin' the best I can

349
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,246
To carry on

350
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:25,708
-I had power
-Power

351
00:21:25,793 --> 00:21:28,169
-I was respected
-Respected

352
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:31,297
But not any more

353
00:21:31,382 --> 00:21:34,092
And I've lost the love of the one

354
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:36,969
Whom I adore

355
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:41,391
Let me tell you 'bout it
Strange

356
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:44,268
Things are happenin' to me

357
00:21:45,813 --> 00:21:49,440
Strange

358
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:51,526
Things

359
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:55,613
Strange

360
00:21:55,698 --> 00:21:58,449
Things are happenin' to me

361
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:00,952
Ain't no doubt about it

362
00:22:03,706 --> 00:22:07,250
Strange

363
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:09,794
Things

364
00:22:10,921 --> 00:22:14,090
Strange

365
00:22:14,425 --> 00:22:16,217
Things

366
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:20,054
Finally!

367
00:22:21,682 --> 00:22:23,099
Hey, who's got my hat?

368
00:22:23,183 --> 00:22:25,977
Look, I'm Woody!
Howdy, howdy, howdy!

369
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,188
Gimme that!

370
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:31,941
Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog,
let me show you something.

371
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:34,944
It looks as though I've been
accepted into your culture.

372
00:22:35,028 --> 00:22:37,947
Your chief, Andy,
inscribed his name on me.

373
00:22:38,031 --> 00:22:39,073
Wow!

374
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,117
With permanent ink too!

375
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:43,828
Well, I must get back
to repairing my ship.

376
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,542
Don't let it get to you, Woody.

377
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:52,003
Let what? I don't...
What do you mean? Who?

378
00:22:52,087 --> 00:22:55,173
I know Andy's
excited about Buzz.

379
00:22:55,257 --> 00:22:58,634
But you know he'll always have
a special place for you.

380
00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:02,597
-Yeah, like the attic.
-All right, that's it!

381
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:05,641
Unidirectional bonding strip.

382
00:23:05,726 --> 00:23:08,102
Mr Lightyear wants more tape.

383
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,900
Listen, Light Snack,
you stay away from Andy.

384
00:23:13,984 --> 00:23:17,737
He's mine, and no one
is taking him away from me.

385
00:23:17,821 --> 00:23:19,363
What are you talking about?

386
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:21,991
Where's that bonding strip?

387
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:24,577
And another thing,

388
00:23:24,661 --> 00:23:28,873
stop with this spaceman thing!
It's getting on my nerves!

389
00:23:28,957 --> 00:23:31,292
Are you saying you wanna lodge
a complaint with Star Command?

390
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,338
Okay! Well, so you wanna
do it the hard way, huh?

391
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:39,300
-Don't even think about it, cowboy.
-Oh, yeah, tough guy?

392
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,772
The air isn't... toxic.

393
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:56,442
How dare you open a spaceman's
helmet on an uncharted planet!

394
00:23:56,527 --> 00:23:59,862
My eyeballs could've been
sucked from their sockets!

395
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:04,992
You actually think
you're the Buzz Lightyear?

396
00:24:05,452 --> 00:24:08,079
Oh, all this time
I thought it was an act!

397
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:11,958
Hey, guys, look!
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!

398
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:13,292
You're mocking me,
aren't you?

399
00:24:13,377 --> 00:24:16,128
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Buzz, look, an alien!

400
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:17,630
Where?

401
00:24:25,347 --> 00:24:26,889
Yes!

402
00:24:30,394 --> 00:24:31,435
It's Sid!

403
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,271
Don't move!

404
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:35,022
I thought he was at summer camp.

405
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:37,191
They must've kicked him out
early this year.

406
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:39,527
Oh, no, not Sid!

407
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:41,195
Incoming!

408
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:46,367
-Who is it this time?
-I... I can't... I can't tell.

409
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,619
-Hey, where's Lenny?
-Right here, Woody.

410
00:24:48,704 --> 00:24:52,540
Oh, no, I can't bear to watch
one of these again.

411
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,793
Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.

412
00:24:55,878 --> 00:24:56,836
What's going on?

413
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,631
Nothing that concerns you spacemen,
just us toys.

414
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:02,216
I'd better take a look anyway.

415
00:25:03,343 --> 00:25:05,803
Why is that soldier
strapped to an explosive device?

416
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:08,139
That's why, Sid.

417
00:25:09,266 --> 00:25:10,600
Sure is a hairy fellow.

418
00:25:10,684 --> 00:25:12,727
No, no, that's Scud, you idiot.

419
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:15,229
That is Sid.

420
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:19,233
-You mean that happy child?
-That ain't no happy child.

421
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:22,570
He tortures toys, just for fun!

422
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:28,242
Well, then we've got
to do something.

423
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:30,161
What are you doing?
Get down from there!

424
00:25:30,245 --> 00:25:33,497
-I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
-Yeah, sure. You go ahead.

425
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:35,958
Melt him with your scary laser.

426
00:25:36,043 --> 00:25:39,003
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.

427
00:25:39,087 --> 00:25:41,839
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!

428
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,717
Look out!

429
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:51,515
Yes! He's gone! He's history!

430
00:25:53,101 --> 00:25:54,685
I could've stopped him.

431
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,939
Buzz, I would love
to see you try.

432
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:00,483
Of course, I'd love
to see you as a crater.

433
00:26:01,568 --> 00:26:04,195
The sooner we move, the better.

434
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,072
Yeah!

435
00:26:12,245 --> 00:26:14,121
To infinity and beyond!

436
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:17,458
All this packing
makes me hungry.

437
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,461
What would you say to dinner
at, oh, Pizza Planet?

438
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:23,464
Pizza Planet? Oh, cool!

439
00:26:24,257 --> 00:26:26,300
Go wash your hands,
and I'll get Molly ready.

440
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:29,679
-Can I bring some toys?
-You can bring one toy.

441
00:26:29,763 --> 00:26:32,723
-Just one?
-One toy?

442
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,189
Will Andy pick me?

443
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,778
"Don't count on it"?

444
00:27:06,883 --> 00:27:09,510
Buzz! Oh, Buzz!
Buzz Lightyear.

445
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,929
Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness.
We've got trouble!

446
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:14,682
-Trouble? Where?
-Down there. Just down there.

447
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,518
A helpless toy, it's...
it's trapped, Buzz!

448
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:20,020
Then we've no time to lose.

449
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:26,986
I don't see anything!

450
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,280
Oh, he's there!
Just, just keep looking!

451
00:27:29,364 --> 00:27:30,656
What kind of toy...

452
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:50,426
Buzz!

453
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,719
Buzz!

454
00:27:53,054 --> 00:27:54,930
I don't see him in the driveway.

455
00:27:55,015 --> 00:27:58,642
-I think he bounced into Sid's yard!
-Oh! Buzz!

456
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:04,940
Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to
say something. What is it, boy?

457
00:28:05,025 --> 00:28:08,736
-He's saying that this was no accident.
-What do you mean?

458
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,238
-I mean Humpty-Dumpty was pushed...
-No!

459
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:12,573
...by Woody!

460
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,492
-What?
-Wait a minute.

461
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:18,829
You don't think I meant to knock Buzz
out the window, do you? Potato Head?

462
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:21,999
That's Mr Potato Head to you,
you back-stabbing murderer!

463
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:24,168
Now, it was an accident, guys.

464
00:28:24,252 --> 00:28:27,046
Come on.
Now, you, you gotta believe me.

465
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:30,591
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?

466
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,177
Well, ye... N...
I don't like confrontations!

467
00:28:33,261 --> 00:28:36,931
Where is your honour, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!

468
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,641
You don't deserve to... Hey!

469
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:42,019
You couldn't handle Buzz cutting
in on your playtime, could you, Woody?

470
00:28:42,103 --> 00:28:46,190
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz
just might be Andy's new favourite toy.

471
00:28:46,274 --> 00:28:47,566
So you got rid of him.

472
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:50,361
Well, what if Andy starts playing
with me more, Woody, huh?

473
00:28:50,445 --> 00:28:52,363
You gonna knock me
outta the window too?

474
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:54,573
I don't think we should
give him the chance.

475
00:28:54,741 --> 00:28:56,700
There he is, men. Frag him!

476
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:58,285
Let's string him up
by his pull string!

477
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,746
-I got dibs on his hat!
-Would you boys stop it!

478
00:29:00,831 --> 00:29:01,872
Tackle him!

479
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:04,542
No, no, no! Wait!
I can explain everything!

480
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:07,545
Okay, Mom, be right down.
I've gotta get Buzz.

481
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:08,754
Retreat!

482
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:15,719
Mom, do you know
where Buzz is?

483
00:29:15,804 --> 00:29:17,304
No, I haven't seen him.

484
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,352
-Andy, I'm heading out the door!
-But, Mom, I can't find him!

485
00:29:23,436 --> 00:29:25,896
Honey, just grab some other toy.
Now, come on!

486
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:27,982
Oh, okay.

487
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:36,407
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.

488
00:29:36,491 --> 00:29:39,493
Honey, I'm sure he's around.
You'll find him.

489
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:56,260
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!

490
00:29:56,344 --> 00:29:59,430
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!

491
00:30:00,724 --> 00:30:02,766
Buzz, the monkeys
aren't working!

492
00:30:02,851 --> 00:30:06,812
We're formulating another plan!
Stay calm!

493
00:30:06,897 --> 00:30:08,856
Oh, where could he be?

494
00:30:20,535 --> 00:30:23,704
-Can I help pump the gas?
-Sure! I'll even let you drive.

495
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,789
-Yeah?
-Yeah, when you're 16.

496
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:27,791
Funny, Mom.

497
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:32,296
Great. How am I gonna convince
those guys it was an accident?

498
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,927
Buzz!

499
00:30:39,554 --> 00:30:42,306
Buzz! Ha! You're alive!

500
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,643
This is great!
Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved.

501
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:48,228
Andy'll find you here,
he'll take us back to the room

502
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:53,525
and then you can tell everyone
that this was all just a big mistake.

503
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,403
Huh? Right? Buddy?

504
00:30:56,905 --> 00:30:59,865
I just want you to know that even
though you tried to terminate me,

505
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,826
revenge is not an idea
we promote on my planet.

506
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:06,956
-Oh. Well, that's good.
-But we're not on my planet, are we?

507
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
No.

508
00:31:14,631 --> 00:31:16,632
Okay, come on!

509
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,884
You want a piece of me?

510
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:28,477
Buzz, Buzz,
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.

511
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:31,480
-Next stop.
-Pizza Planet! Yeah!

512
00:31:34,317 --> 00:31:35,317
Andy!

513
00:31:44,077 --> 00:31:46,620
Wh... Doesn't he realise
that I'm not there?

514
00:31:48,498 --> 00:31:50,290
I'm lost!

515
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,627
Oh, I'm a lost toy!

516
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:00,259
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

517
00:32:00,343 --> 00:32:03,721
The local sheriff and I seem to be at
a huge refuelling station of some sort.

518
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:04,847
You!

519
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:28,370
-According to my navi-computer, the...
-Shut up!

520
00:32:28,455 --> 00:32:31,749
-Just shut up, you idiot!
-Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

521
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:35,419
This is the perfect time to panic.
I'm lost. Andy is gone.

522
00:32:35,503 --> 00:32:37,713
They're gonna move from their house
in two days, and it's all your fault!

523
00:32:37,797 --> 00:32:40,924
My... My fault? If you hadn't pushed me
out of the window in the first place...

524
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:42,092
Oh, yeah?

525
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:45,262
Well, if you hadn't shown up in your
stupid little cardboard spaceship

526
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:47,473
and taken away everything
that was important to me...

527
00:32:47,557 --> 00:32:48,932
Don't talk to me
about importance!

528
00:32:49,017 --> 00:32:52,061
Because of you the security
of this entire universe is in jeopardy!

529
00:32:52,145 --> 00:32:54,605
What? What are
you talkin' about?

530
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:57,399
Right now, poised at
the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg

531
00:32:57,484 --> 00:32:59,109
has been secretly building
a weapon

532
00:32:59,194 --> 00:33:02,446
with the destructive capacity
to annihilate an entire planet!

533
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:06,784
I alone have information that reveals
this weapon's only weakness.

534
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:09,078
And you, my friend,
are responsible

535
00:33:09,162 --> 00:33:12,539
for delaying my rendezvous
with Star Command!

536
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:16,126
You... are... a... toy!

537
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:18,462
You aren't the real
Buzz Lightyear! You're a...

538
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:23,342
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!

539
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,971
You are a sad, strange little man,
and you have my pity.

540
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:29,223
Farewell.

541
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:32,392
Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, ya loony!

542
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,812
"Rendezvous with Star Command."

543
00:33:36,189 --> 00:33:38,440
-Hey, gas dude!
-You talkin' to me?

544
00:33:38,525 --> 00:33:40,984
-Yeah, man. Can you help me?
-Pizza Planet? Andy!

545
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:43,028
Do you know
where Cutting Boulevard is?

546
00:33:43,113 --> 00:33:44,488
Oh, no!

547
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:47,449
I can't show my face
in that room without Buzz.

548
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:50,452
-Buzz! Buzz, come back!
-Go away!

549
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:53,914
No! Buzz, you gotta
come back! I...

550
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:58,127
I found a spaceship!

551
00:33:59,796 --> 00:34:02,005
It's a spaceship, Buzz!

552
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:07,094
Come on, man, hurry up! Like,
the pizzas are getting cold here!

553
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:10,806
-Cutting Boulevard, huh?
-Yeah, yeah. Which way?

554
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:13,767
Now, you're sure this space freighter
will return to its port of origin

555
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:16,270
once it jettisons its food supply?

556
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:20,774
And when we get there, we'll be able
to find a way to transport you home.

557
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:24,403
-Well, then, let's climb aboard.
-No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz!

558
00:34:24,487 --> 00:34:26,530
Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.

559
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:29,825
Negative. There are no restraining
harnesses in the cargo area.

560
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:32,119
-We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
-Yeah, bu...

561
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:34,496
Buzz! Buzz!

562
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:36,039
That's two lefts
and a right, huh?

563
00:34:36,124 --> 00:34:39,042
-Thanks for the directions, okay?
-Yeah. And remember, kid...

564
00:34:39,127 --> 00:34:40,544
Buzz!

565
00:34:53,016 --> 00:34:55,851
It's safer in the cockpit
than the cargo bay. What an idiot.

566
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:22,419
Next shuttle lift-off
is scheduled for

567
00:35:22,503 --> 00:35:25,923
T-minus 30 minutes and counting.

568
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,511
You are clear to enter.

569
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,388
Welcome to Pizza Planet.

570
00:35:34,682 --> 00:35:37,184
The white zone
is for immediate pizza...

571
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:38,769
Sheriff!

572
00:35:40,521 --> 00:35:41,939
There you are.

573
00:35:42,523 --> 00:35:45,317
Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.
We need a way to get inside.

574
00:35:47,362 --> 00:35:48,612
Great idea, Woody.

575
00:35:48,696 --> 00:35:50,822
I like your thinkin'.

576
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,785
You are clear to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.

577
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:56,536
Now!

578
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,456
Quickly, Sheriff!
The air lock is closing.

579
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,167
Jones, party of five,
your shuttle is now boarding...

580
00:36:02,252 --> 00:36:04,211
Hey, Mom,
can we have some tokens?

581
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,922
Watch where you're going!

582
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:08,465
Sorry.

583
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:18,684
...nine, eight, seven, six,

584
00:36:18,768 --> 00:36:21,853
five, four, three,

585
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:23,897
two, one.

586
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:27,526
What a spaceport!
Good work, Woody.

587
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:39,162
Mom, can I play Black Hole?
Please, please, please?

588
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:41,164
-Andy!
-Now, we need to find a ship

589
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:44,668
-that's headed for Sector 12.
-Wait a minute. No, Buzz! This way.

590
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:48,088
-There's a special ship. I just saw it.
-You mean it has hyperdrive?

591
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:50,799
Hyperactive hyperdrive.

592
00:36:50,883 --> 00:36:53,760
And Astro... turf!

593
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:56,346
-Where is it? I don't see the...
-Come on. That's it.

594
00:36:56,431 --> 00:36:57,848
Spaceship!

595
00:36:59,642 --> 00:37:02,894
All right, Buzz, get ready.
And...

596
00:37:02,979 --> 00:37:04,813
-And the universe explodes!
-Okay, Buzz, when I say go,

597
00:37:04,897 --> 00:37:07,566
we're gonna jump in the basket.
Buzz!

598
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:11,278
-No!
-Mom, if I eat all my pizza,

599
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,863
can I have some alien slime?

600
00:37:13,656 --> 00:37:15,699
This cannot be happening to me.

601
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:27,210
-A stranger.
-From the outside.

602
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:31,882
Greetings. I am Buzz Lightyear.

603
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:34,384
I come in peace.

604
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:39,931
Before your space journey,
re-energise yourself

605
00:37:40,016 --> 00:37:43,643
with a slice of pepperoni,
now boarding at counter three.

606
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,605
This is an intergalactic emergency.

607
00:37:46,689 --> 00:37:49,149
I need to commandeer
your vessel to Sector 12.

608
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,610
Who's in charge here?

609
00:37:51,694 --> 00:37:54,529
The claw!

610
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:57,866
The claw is our master.

611
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,202
The claw chooses who will go
and who will stay.

612
00:38:00,286 --> 00:38:03,705
-This is ludicrous.
-Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?

613
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,208
Take that!

614
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:09,586
Oh, no! Sid!

615
00:38:10,004 --> 00:38:11,254
Get down!

616
00:38:13,633 --> 00:38:14,925
What's gotten into you? I was...

617
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:17,177
You are the one that decided
to climb into this...

618
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,679
The claw, it moves.

619
00:38:25,186 --> 00:38:26,520
I have been chosen!

620
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:30,232
Farewell, my friends.
I go on to a better place.

621
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:32,651
Gotcha!

622
00:38:34,404 --> 00:38:37,447
A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!

623
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,424
Yes!

624
00:38:55,508 --> 00:38:57,342
Buzz! No!

625
00:38:58,928 --> 00:39:00,053
Hey!

626
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:03,598
He has been chosen!

627
00:39:03,683 --> 00:39:05,308
-He must go.
-Hey!

628
00:39:05,393 --> 00:39:06,935
-What are you doing?
-Do not fight the claw.

629
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:09,146
Stop it! Stop it, you zealots!

630
00:39:12,692 --> 00:39:15,444
All right!
Double prizes!

631
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:20,740
Let's go home and... play.

632
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:37,257
Sheriff, I can see
your dwelling from here.

633
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:39,468
-You're almost home.
-Nirvana is coming.

634
00:39:39,552 --> 00:39:42,137
-The mystic portal awaits.
-Will you be quiet?

635
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:43,680
You guys don't get it, do you?

636
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:47,058
Once we go into Sid's house,
we won't be coming out.

637
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:49,603
Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy!

638
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,730
Sit! Good boy.

639
00:39:51,814 --> 00:39:54,608
-Hey, I got something for you, boy.
-Freeze!

640
00:39:57,111 --> 00:39:59,279
Ready, set, now!

641
00:40:00,656 --> 00:40:03,158
Hannah!
Hey, Hannah!

642
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:05,368
-What?
-Did I get my package in the mail?

643
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:07,871
-I don't know.
-What do you mean you don't know?

644
00:40:07,955 --> 00:40:09,748
I don't know!

645
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:13,543
-Oh, no, Hannah! Look, Janie!
-What? Hey!

646
00:40:13,628 --> 00:40:15,420
-She's sick!
-No, she's not!

647
00:40:15,505 --> 00:40:17,964
I'll have to perform
one of my operations.

648
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:20,675
-No!
-No, not Sid's room. Not there.

649
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,636
Hey, give her back!

650
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,554
Sid! Sid!

651
00:40:25,473 --> 00:40:28,767
Oh, no, we have
a sick patient here, nurse.

652
00:40:28,851 --> 00:40:30,810
Prepare the OR, stat!

653
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,148
Patient is... prepped.

654
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:40,737
No one's ever attempted a double
bypass brain transplant before.

655
00:40:41,822 --> 00:40:44,574
Now for the tricky part.
Pliers!

656
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:47,452
I don't believe that man's
ever been to medical school.

657
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:52,082
Doctor, you've done it!

658
00:40:53,334 --> 00:40:54,751
Hannah!

659
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:56,836
Janie's all better now.

660
00:40:58,005 --> 00:41:01,550
-Mom! Mom!
-She's lying!

661
00:41:01,634 --> 00:41:04,261
Whatever she says,
it's not true!

662
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:19,442
We are gonna die.
I'm outta here!

663
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:25,740
Locked.

664
00:41:25,825 --> 00:41:28,034
There's gotta be another way
outta here.

665
00:41:40,214 --> 00:41:42,507
Buzz? Was that you?

666
00:41:52,101 --> 00:41:54,561
Hey, hi there, little fella.

667
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:58,064
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?

668
00:42:28,095 --> 00:42:29,846
Buzz!

669
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:43,276
They're cannibals.

670
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:47,614
Mayday, mayday.

671
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,949
Come in, Star Command.
Send reinforcements.

672
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:52,369
Star Command, do you copy?

673
00:42:52,787 --> 00:42:55,205
I've set my laser from stun to kill.

674
00:42:55,289 --> 00:42:59,459
Great. Great. Yeah, and if anyone
attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.

675
00:43:02,963 --> 00:43:05,006
Hey, you guys,
I think I found him!

676
00:43:05,091 --> 00:43:07,801
Buzz, is that you?

677
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,886
Whiskers, will you
get outta here!

678
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,847
You're interfering
with the search and rescue!

679
00:43:14,308 --> 00:43:16,142
Look, they're home.

680
00:43:21,315 --> 00:43:22,899
Mom, have you seen Woody?

681
00:43:22,983 --> 00:43:24,567
Where was the last place
you left him?

682
00:43:24,652 --> 00:43:25,902
Right here in the van.

683
00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:28,655
Oh, I'm sure he's there.
You're just not looking hard enough.

684
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:31,241
He's not here, Mom.
Woody's gone.

685
00:43:32,493 --> 00:43:33,702
Woody's gone?

686
00:43:33,786 --> 00:43:35,745
Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away.

687
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,914
Huh? Huh?
I told you he was guilty.

688
00:43:37,998 --> 00:43:42,252
Who would've thought he was
capable of such atrocities?

689
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:46,548
Oh, Slink,
I hope he's okay.

690
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:54,597
Oh, a survivor.
Where's the rebel base? Talk!

691
00:43:57,017 --> 00:43:59,561
I can see your will is strong.

692
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:04,357
Well, we have ways
of making you talk.

693
00:44:14,076 --> 00:44:17,287
Where are your rebel friends now?

694
00:44:18,038 --> 00:44:20,290
Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!

695
00:44:20,374 --> 00:44:22,000
All right!

696
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:36,306
Are you all right?
I'm proud of you, Sheriff.

697
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:39,058
A lesser man would've talked
under such torture.

698
00:44:39,852 --> 00:44:42,145
I sure hope this isn't permanent.

699
00:44:42,229 --> 00:44:45,482
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the space port.

700
00:44:45,566 --> 00:44:47,984
The door. It's open!
We're free!

701
00:44:48,068 --> 00:44:49,194
Woody, we don't know
what's out there!

702
00:44:49,278 --> 00:44:50,570
I'll tell you wha...

703
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:55,033
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!
Do something quick!

704
00:44:55,117 --> 00:44:56,951
Shield your eyes.

705
00:44:58,913 --> 00:45:01,748
It's not working. I recharged it
before I left. It should be good for...

706
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:05,460
You idiot! You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!

707
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,254
-Get away!
-Hey! Hey! How're you doin' that?

708
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:11,174
-Stop that.
-Back! Back, you savages! Back!

709
00:45:11,258 --> 00:45:14,969
-Woody, stop it!
-Sorry, guys, but dinner's cancelled!

710
00:45:15,304 --> 00:45:17,889
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home!

711
00:45:18,766 --> 00:45:20,433
There's no place like home.

712
00:45:34,657 --> 00:45:36,991
Another stunt like that, cowboy,
you're gonna get us killed.

713
00:45:37,076 --> 00:45:39,452
Don't tell me what to do.

714
00:45:58,806 --> 00:46:02,267
Yee-haw! Giddyap, pardner!

715
00:46:02,351 --> 00:46:05,144
We got to get this wagon train
a-movin'!

716
00:46:07,982 --> 00:46:09,274
Split up!

717
00:46:31,505 --> 00:46:33,798
Calling Buzz Lightyear.
Come in, Buzz Lightyear.

718
00:46:34,341 --> 00:46:36,009
-This is Star Command.
-Star Command!

719
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,595
-Buzz Lightyear, do you read me?
-Buzz Lightyear responding.

720
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:39,762
Read you loud and clear.

721
00:46:39,847 --> 00:46:42,348
Buzz Lightyear,
planet Earth needs your help.

722
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:44,601
-On the way!
-Buzz Lightyear!

723
00:46:44,685 --> 00:46:49,188
The world's greatest superhero!
Now the world's greatest toy!

724
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:52,233
Buzz has it all!
Locking wrist communicator!

725
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:54,777
-Calling Buzz Lightyear!
-Karate chop action!

726
00:46:54,862 --> 00:46:56,863
-Wow!
-Pulsating laser light!

727
00:46:56,947 --> 00:47:00,325
-Total annihilation!
-Multi-phrase voice simulator!

728
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:02,535
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space.

729
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,454
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space.

730
00:47:04,538 --> 00:47:07,790
And best of all,
high pressure space wings!

731
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:11,586
-To infinity and beyond!
-Not a flying toy.

732
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:13,296
Get your Buzz Lightyear action figure

733
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,633
-and save a galaxy near you!
-Buzz Lightyear!

734
00:47:16,717 --> 00:47:20,219
Available at all Al's Toy Barn outlets
in the tri-county area.

735
00:47:21,555 --> 00:47:24,599
And welcome back to the Point
Richmond Bowling Championship.

736
00:47:27,686 --> 00:47:32,023
Out among the stars I sail

737
00:47:32,107 --> 00:47:34,817
Way beyond the moon

738
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:40,865
In my silver ship I sailed

739
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:45,078
To a dream
that ended too soon

740
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,997
Now I know exactly

741
00:47:48,082 --> 00:47:51,584
Who I am and what I'm here for

742
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:55,088
You are a toy! You can't fly!

743
00:47:56,924 --> 00:48:01,427
And I will go sailing

744
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,139
No more

745
00:48:09,812 --> 00:48:13,773
But no, it can't be true

746
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:17,026
I could fly if I wanted to

747
00:48:17,111 --> 00:48:19,821
Like a bird in the sky

748
00:48:19,905 --> 00:48:22,740
If I believed I could fly

749
00:48:22,825 --> 00:48:25,451
Why, I'd fly

750
00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:28,329
To infinity and beyond!

751
00:48:44,138 --> 00:48:47,890
Clearly, I

752
00:48:47,975 --> 00:48:52,687
Will go sailing

753
00:48:52,771 --> 00:48:55,356
No more

754
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,914
Mom! Mom, have you seen
my Sally doll?

755
00:49:12,624 --> 00:49:14,834
What, dear? What was that?

756
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,545
Never mind!

757
00:49:24,845 --> 00:49:27,680
Buzz, the coast is clear.
Buzz, where are you?

758
00:49:27,765 --> 00:49:31,267
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space. Let's go.

759
00:49:31,351 --> 00:49:34,687
Really?
That is so interesting.

760
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:38,399
Would you like some tea,
Mrs Nesbitt?

761
00:49:39,026 --> 00:49:40,026
Buzz!

762
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,987
It's so nice you could join us
on such late notice.

763
00:49:43,072 --> 00:49:46,657
-Oh, no!
-What a lovely hat, Mrs Nesbitt.

764
00:49:46,742 --> 00:49:48,910
It goes quite well with your head.

765
00:49:49,828 --> 00:49:52,288
Hannah! Oh, Hannah!

766
00:49:52,372 --> 00:49:55,124
Mom? Please excuse me, ladies.

767
00:49:55,209 --> 00:49:57,001
I'll be right back.

768
00:49:59,755 --> 00:50:03,800
What is it, Mom?
Mom, where are you?

769
00:50:03,884 --> 00:50:06,385
Buzz. Hey.
Buzz, are you okay?

770
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:09,639
Gone! It's all gone.

771
00:50:09,723 --> 00:50:12,600
All of it's gone.
Bye-bye. See ya.

772
00:50:12,684 --> 00:50:13,726
What happened to you?

773
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:16,479
One minute you're defending
the whole galaxy.

774
00:50:16,563 --> 00:50:20,525
And suddenly you find yourself
suckin' down Darfeeling with

775
00:50:20,609 --> 00:50:23,778
Marie Antoinette
and her little sister.

776
00:50:25,697 --> 00:50:27,990
I think you've had
enough tea for today.

777
00:50:28,075 --> 00:50:29,826
Let's get you outta here, Buzz.

778
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:32,870
Don't you get it?
You see the hat?

779
00:50:32,955 --> 00:50:37,917
-I am Mrs Nesbitt!
-Snap out of it, Buzz!

780
00:50:41,797 --> 00:50:44,006
I'm sorry. I...
You're right.

781
00:50:44,091 --> 00:50:46,968
I am just a little depressed.
That's all.

782
00:50:47,052 --> 00:50:49,095
I can get through this.

783
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,972
Oh, I'm a sham!

784
00:50:51,056 --> 00:50:52,348
-Look at me.
-Quiet, Buzz.

785
00:50:52,432 --> 00:50:55,309
I can't even fly out of a window.

786
00:50:55,394 --> 00:50:58,646
The hat looked good?
Tell me the hat looked good.

787
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:01,524
-The apron is a bit much.
-"Out the window"!

788
00:51:01,608 --> 00:51:03,901
Buzz, you're a genius!

789
00:51:03,986 --> 00:51:05,319
Come on, come on. This way.

790
00:51:05,404 --> 00:51:08,573
Years of academy, training, wasted!

791
00:51:09,783 --> 00:51:11,033
B-3.

792
00:51:11,118 --> 00:51:13,202
Miss! G-6.

793
00:51:13,287 --> 00:51:15,496
You sunk it. Are you peeking?

794
00:51:15,581 --> 00:51:18,875
Oh, quit your whinin' and pay up.
No, no, not the ear.

795
00:51:18,959 --> 00:51:21,419
-Give me the nose. Come on.
-How about three out of five?

796
00:51:22,796 --> 00:51:25,798
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

797
00:51:26,466 --> 00:51:29,552
-Son of a building block. It's Woody.
-He's in the psycho's bedroom.

798
00:51:29,636 --> 00:51:32,054
-Hi!
-Everyone! It's Woody!

799
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:33,139
-Woody?
-You're kidding!

800
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:36,350
-Woody?
-We're gonna get outta here, Buzz.

801
00:51:36,852 --> 00:51:38,060
Buzz?

802
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,525
-Hey, look!
-Woody!

803
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:46,736
Oh, boy, am I glad
to see you guys.

804
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:49,488
-I knew you'd come back, Woody.
-What are you doin' over there?

805
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:52,033
It's a long story, Bo.
I'll explain later.

806
00:51:52,117 --> 00:51:54,118
Here! Catch this!

807
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:57,705
-Whoa! I've got it, Woody.
-He got it, Woody.

808
00:51:57,789 --> 00:52:00,666
Good goin', Slink. Now just,
just tie it on to somethin'.

809
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:03,252
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got
a better idea. How 'bout we don't?

810
00:52:03,337 --> 00:52:04,670
-Hey!
-Potato Head.

811
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:06,714
Did you all take stupid pills
this morning?

812
00:52:06,798 --> 00:52:08,758
Have you forgotten
what he did to Buzz?

813
00:52:08,842 --> 00:52:10,384
And now you wanna let him
back over here?

814
00:52:10,469 --> 00:52:14,889
No! No, no, no, no, no! You got it...
You got it all wrong, Potato Head.

815
00:52:14,973 --> 00:52:17,308
Buzz is fine. Buzz is right here.
He's with me!

816
00:52:17,392 --> 00:52:20,686
-You are a liar!
-No, I'm not. Buzz, come over here.

817
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:24,523
Tell the nice toys that you're...
that you're not dead.

818
00:52:27,402 --> 00:52:28,444
Just a sec!

819
00:52:28,528 --> 00:52:31,656
Buzz, will you get up here
and give me a hand?

820
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:35,159
That's very funny, Buzz.

821
00:52:35,244 --> 00:52:38,329
-This is serious!
-Hey, Woody! Where'd ya go?

822
00:52:38,413 --> 00:52:40,498
He's lying. Buzz ain't there.

823
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:43,292
Oh! Hi, Buzz!

824
00:52:43,377 --> 00:52:46,462
Why don't you say hello
to the guys over there?

825
00:52:46,546 --> 00:52:50,258
Hiya, fellas!
To infinity and beyond!

826
00:52:50,342 --> 00:52:52,134
Hey, look! It's Buzz!

827
00:52:52,219 --> 00:52:57,139
Hey, Buzz, let's show the guys
our new secret best friends handshake.

828
00:52:57,224 --> 00:52:58,557
Give me five, man!

829
00:52:58,642 --> 00:52:59,809
Something's screwy here.

830
00:52:59,893 --> 00:53:02,770
So you see we're friends now, guys.
Aren't we, Buzz?

831
00:53:02,854 --> 00:53:04,772
You bet. Give me a hug.

832
00:53:05,899 --> 00:53:07,316
Boy, I love you too.

833
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:08,985
See? It is Buzz.

834
00:53:09,069 --> 00:53:10,695
Now give back the lights,
Potato Head.

835
00:53:10,779 --> 00:53:12,238
Wait just a minute.

836
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,865
-What are you tryin' to pull?
-Nothing!

837
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:20,913
-Oh, that is disgusting.
-Murderer!

838
00:53:20,998 --> 00:53:23,082
-No! No, no, no, no, no!
-You murdering dog!

839
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:25,501
-It's not what you think. I swear!
-Save it for the jury.

840
00:53:25,585 --> 00:53:28,170
I hope Sid pulls
your voice box out, ya creep.

841
00:53:28,255 --> 00:53:30,172
No, no! No, no!
Don't leave! Don't leave!

842
00:53:30,257 --> 00:53:33,217
Ya gotta help us, please! You don't
know what it's like over here!

843
00:53:33,302 --> 00:53:34,635
Come on.
Let's get outta here.

844
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,346
Go back to your lives, citizens.
Show's over.

845
00:53:37,431 --> 00:53:40,016
Come back! Slink!

846
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:44,020
Slink! Please!
Please! Listen to me!

847
00:53:44,104 --> 00:53:47,356
No! No! Come back!

848
00:53:47,441 --> 00:53:49,942
Slinky!

849
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:01,203
Buzz! Go away!

850
00:54:01,288 --> 00:54:02,997
You disgusting freaks!

851
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:06,751
All right, back!
Back, you cannibals!

852
00:54:11,506 --> 00:54:15,176
He is still alive, and you're
not gonna get him, you monsters!

853
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,053
What are you doin'?

854
00:54:19,973 --> 00:54:22,058
Hey. Hey, they fixed you.

855
00:54:25,645 --> 00:54:27,188
But they're cannibals.

856
00:54:27,272 --> 00:54:29,815
We saw them eat
those other toys.

857
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:40,701
Sorry. I thought
that you were gonna...

858
00:54:41,536 --> 00:54:43,371
You know, you know, eat my friend.

859
00:54:43,663 --> 00:54:45,539
Hey, no, no, wait, hey!

860
00:54:45,624 --> 00:54:47,041
-What's wrong?
-Sid?

861
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:48,793
Not now, Mom! I'm busy!

862
00:54:48,877 --> 00:54:51,295
-Sid! Buzz, come on!
-You left that door open.

863
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:55,800
Get up! Use your legs! Fine!
Let Sid trash you! But don't blame me!

864
00:54:58,095 --> 00:55:01,347
It came!
It finally came!

865
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,185
"The Big One."

866
00:55:09,147 --> 00:55:11,607
"Extremely dangerous.

867
00:55:11,691 --> 00:55:14,402
"Keep out of reach of children."

868
00:55:15,695 --> 00:55:18,948
Cool! What am I gonna blow?

869
00:55:19,032 --> 00:55:21,909
Man. Hey, where's
that wimpy cowboy doll?

870
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:41,220
Yes. I've always wanted
to put a spaceman into orbit.

871
00:55:51,022 --> 00:55:53,149
Now. Yes.

872
00:55:57,571 --> 00:55:59,530
Oh, no!

873
00:56:02,075 --> 00:56:03,742
Oh, man!

874
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:12,168
Sid Phillips reporting.

875
00:56:12,252 --> 00:56:13,794
Launch of the shuttle
has been delayed

876
00:56:13,879 --> 00:56:16,547
due to adverse weather
conditions at the launch site.

877
00:56:16,631 --> 00:56:19,508
Tomorrow's forecast, sunny.

878
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:22,720
Sweet dreams.

879
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:31,604
I looked everywhere, honey,
but all I could find was your hat.

880
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,856
But what if we
leave them behind?

881
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,691
Oh, don't worry, honey.

882
00:56:35,775 --> 00:56:39,195
I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz
before we leave tomorrow.

883
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:48,787
I need air!

884
00:56:49,456 --> 00:56:50,956
Will you quit movin' around?

885
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:54,668
I'm sorry. It's just that I get...
I get so nervous before I travel.

886
00:56:54,753 --> 00:56:57,171
How did I get stuck
with you as a moving buddy?

887
00:56:57,255 --> 00:56:59,423
Everyone else was picked.

888
00:57:06,139 --> 00:57:07,515
Oh, Woody.

889
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,436
If only you could see
how much Andy misses you.

890
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:28,077
Hey, Buzz!

891
00:57:34,668 --> 00:57:38,504
Hey. Get over here and see if
you can get this toolbox off me.

892
00:57:41,216 --> 00:57:44,051
Oh, come on, Buzz, I...

893
00:57:44,135 --> 00:57:48,264
Buzz, I can't do this without you.
I need your help.

894
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:53,143
I can't help.
I can't help anyone.

895
00:57:53,228 --> 00:57:56,105
Why, sure you can, Buzz.
You can get me outta here.

896
00:57:56,189 --> 00:57:59,525
Then I'll get that rocket off you, and
we'll make a break for Andy's house.

897
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:03,112
Andy's house, Sid's house.
What's the difference?

898
00:58:03,196 --> 00:58:07,283
Oh, Buzz. You've had a big fall.
You must not be thinking clearly.

899
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:10,828
No, Woody. For the first time
I am thinking clearly.

900
00:58:10,912 --> 00:58:13,581
You were right all along.
I'm not a Space Ranger.

901
00:58:13,665 --> 00:58:17,876
I'm just a toy, a stupid,
little, insignificant toy.

902
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:19,211
Whoa, hey, wait a minute.

903
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:22,715
Bein' a toy is a lot better
than bein' a, a Space Ranger.

904
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,134
-Yeah, right.
-No, it is.

905
00:58:25,218 --> 00:58:28,262
Look, over in that house is a kid
who thinks you are the greatest.

906
00:58:28,346 --> 00:58:31,015
And it's not because
you're a Space Ranger, pal.

907
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:34,977
It's because you're a toy.
You are his toy.

908
00:58:35,061 --> 00:58:36,645
But why would Andy want me?

909
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:42,026
Why would Andy want you?
Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear.

910
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:44,820
Any other toy would give up
his moving parts just to be you.

911
00:58:44,904 --> 00:58:48,449
You've got wings.
You glow in the dark. You talk!

912
00:58:48,533 --> 00:58:51,910
Your helmet does
that, that, that whoosh thing.

913
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:55,080
You are a cool toy.

914
00:58:58,585 --> 00:59:01,420
As a matter of fact,
you're too cool.

915
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:05,257
I mean, I mean, what chance
does a toy like me have

916
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:08,636
against a Buzz Lightyear
action figure?

917
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,305
All I can do is...

918
00:59:11,389 --> 00:59:15,809
There's a snake in my boots.

919
00:59:15,894 --> 00:59:18,187
Why would Andy ever want
to play with me

920
00:59:18,271 --> 00:59:20,981
when he's got you?

921
00:59:21,775 --> 00:59:25,444
I'm the one that should be
strapped to that rocket.

922
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:51,303
Listen, Buzz, forget about me.

923
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:54,306
You should get outta here
while you can.

924
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:07,611
Buzz? What are you doin'?
I thought you were...

925
01:00:07,696 --> 01:00:10,739
Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid
over in that house who needs us.

926
01:00:10,824 --> 01:00:12,783
Now let's get
you out of this thing.

927
01:00:12,867 --> 01:00:14,243
Yes, sir!

928
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:18,956
Come on, Buzz.
We can do it.

929
01:00:25,004 --> 01:00:26,755
Woody, it's the moving van.

930
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,007
We gotta get outta here now.

931
01:00:33,847 --> 01:00:35,472
Come on, Buzz.

932
01:00:37,058 --> 01:00:38,267
All right.

933
01:00:39,728 --> 01:00:42,521
-Hey, I'm out!
-Almost there.

934
01:00:47,569 --> 01:00:49,862
I want to ride the pony.

935
01:00:54,033 --> 01:00:57,578
Woody? Woody?
Are you all right?

936
01:00:58,455 --> 01:01:01,039
I'm fine. I'm okay.

937
01:01:11,593 --> 01:01:15,053
Oh, yeah!
Time for lift-off!

938
01:01:18,016 --> 01:01:20,893
To infinity and beyond!

939
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:32,112
Back, back.

940
01:01:32,197 --> 01:01:33,947
Down, down!

941
01:01:34,616 --> 01:01:36,700
Okay, what do I do?
Come on, Woody. Think.

942
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,079
Guys!

943
01:01:42,791 --> 01:01:45,334
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Wait. Listen, please.

944
01:01:45,418 --> 01:01:46,752
There's a good toy down there,

945
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:49,963
and he's gonna be blown
to bits in a few minutes.

946
01:01:50,048 --> 01:01:53,592
All because of me.
We gotta save him.

947
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:56,428
And...
But I need your help.

948
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:06,480
Please. He's my friend.

949
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:09,900
And he's the only one I've got.

950
01:02:23,122 --> 01:02:26,792
Thank you.
Okay, I think I know what to do.

951
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,961
We're gonna have
to break a few rules.

952
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:32,172
But if it works,
it'll help everybody.

953
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:45,853
Houston to Mission Control.
Come in, Control.

954
01:02:46,145 --> 01:02:49,314
Launch pad is being constructed.

955
01:02:51,025 --> 01:02:52,234
All right, listen up.

956
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:55,112
I need Pump Boy here,
Ducky here.

957
01:02:55,196 --> 01:02:57,906
Legs, you're with Ducky.

958
01:02:58,658 --> 01:03:01,326
RollerBob and I don't move
'til we get the signal. Clear?

959
01:03:02,495 --> 01:03:04,872
Okay. Let's move!

960
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:26,894
Wind the frog.

961
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:51,209
Wait for the signal.

962
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:08,101
Go!

963
01:04:11,731 --> 01:04:13,565
All right, let's go!

964
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:15,609
I'll get it!

965
01:04:15,693 --> 01:04:16,902
Now!

966
01:04:17,612 --> 01:04:19,404
I'm coming. I'm coming.

967
01:04:29,415 --> 01:04:30,749
Scud!

968
01:04:34,921 --> 01:04:36,588
Stupid dog.

969
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:45,889
Lean back!

970
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:54,231
Mission Control, is the
launch pad construction complete?

971
01:04:54,315 --> 01:04:56,858
Roger. Rocket is now
secured to guide wire.

972
01:04:56,943 --> 01:05:00,529
We are currently obtaining
the ignition sticks.

973
01:05:00,613 --> 01:05:02,364
Countdown will commence
momentarily.

974
01:05:02,448 --> 01:05:04,700
-Stand by.
-Let's go.

975
01:05:04,784 --> 01:05:09,037
Hey, Ma! Where are the matches?
Oh, wait. Here they are. Never mind.

976
01:05:09,122 --> 01:05:11,581
Woody! Great!
Help me outta this thing.

977
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:15,544
-What?
-It's okay. Everything's under control.

978
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:18,296
Woody, what are you doing?

979
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:22,634
Houston. All systems are go.
Requesting permission to launch...

980
01:05:23,594 --> 01:05:26,013
Hey? How'd you get out here?

981
01:05:27,682 --> 01:05:30,726
Oh, well. You and I
can have a cookout later.

982
01:05:34,313 --> 01:05:36,773
Houston, do we have
permission to launch?

983
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:39,359
Roger. Permission granted.

984
01:05:39,444 --> 01:05:43,572
You are confirmed
at "T" minus ten seconds.

985
01:05:43,656 --> 01:05:47,409
And counting.
Ten, nine,

986
01:05:47,493 --> 01:05:50,245
eight, seven, six,

987
01:05:50,329 --> 01:05:53,457
five, four, three, two,

988
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:57,669
-one!
-Reach for the sky!

989
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:02,549
This town ain't big enough
for the two of us.

990
01:06:02,633 --> 01:06:03,925
What?

991
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:06,595
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

992
01:06:06,679 --> 01:06:10,682
-It's busted.
-Who are you callin' busted, buster?

993
01:06:11,642 --> 01:06:12,768
That's right.

994
01:06:12,852 --> 01:06:16,563
I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips.

995
01:06:16,647 --> 01:06:19,441
We don't like bein' blown up, Sid,

996
01:06:19,525 --> 01:06:21,485
or smashed or ripped apart.

997
01:06:21,569 --> 01:06:25,030
-"We"?
-That's right! Your toys!

998
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:27,365
Mama!

999
01:06:27,867 --> 01:06:29,201
Mama!

1000
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:32,871
Mama! Mama!

1001
01:06:54,769 --> 01:06:55,977
Mama!

1002
01:06:56,896 --> 01:07:01,108
From now on, you must take
good care of your toys!

1003
01:07:01,192 --> 01:07:05,278
Because if you don't,
we'll find out, Sid.

1004
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:11,701
We toys can see everything.

1005
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:15,247
So play nice.

1006
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:25,048
We did it! We did it! Yes!

1007
01:07:25,133 --> 01:07:27,759
The toys!
The toys are alive!

1008
01:07:28,052 --> 01:07:29,511
Nice toy.

1009
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:34,683
What's wrong, Sid?

1010
01:07:34,767 --> 01:07:37,519
Don't you want to play with Sally?

1011
01:07:38,646 --> 01:07:40,856
Nice work, fellows.
Good job.

1012
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:43,525
Comin' out of the ground, what a touch.
That was a stroke of genius.

1013
01:07:43,609 --> 01:07:45,318
Woody.

1014
01:07:46,779 --> 01:07:48,113
Thanks.

1015
01:07:49,907 --> 01:07:51,700
Everybody say, "Bye, house!"

1016
01:07:51,784 --> 01:07:54,077
-Woody! The van!
-Bye, house.

1017
01:07:56,998 --> 01:07:58,665
We gotta run! Thanks, guys!

1018
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:03,461
Quick!

1019
01:08:08,593 --> 01:08:10,552
Just go. I'll catch up.

1020
01:08:31,908 --> 01:08:33,158
Come on!

1021
01:08:48,674 --> 01:08:50,508
You can do it, Woody!

1022
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:54,512
I got it!

1023
01:08:55,223 --> 01:08:56,681
I made it.

1024
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:04,105
Get away,
you stupid dog! Down!

1025
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:06,775
-Down!
-Hold on, Woody!

1026
01:09:08,027 --> 01:09:10,445
I can't do it.

1027
01:09:11,489 --> 01:09:13,865
Take care of Andy for me!

1028
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:15,492
No!

1029
01:09:16,869 --> 01:09:18,286
Buzz!

1030
01:09:45,564 --> 01:09:46,648
Are we there already?

1031
01:09:46,732 --> 01:09:48,316
-Woody?
-How did you...?

1032
01:09:48,401 --> 01:09:49,693
-How'd he get here?
-Where have you...?

1033
01:09:49,777 --> 01:09:51,027
What happened?

1034
01:09:51,112 --> 01:09:53,238
-What's goin' on?
-What's he takin'?

1035
01:09:54,073 --> 01:09:55,365
There you are!

1036
01:09:55,449 --> 01:09:57,325
Hey. What's he doing?

1037
01:10:00,413 --> 01:10:02,163
He's at it again!

1038
01:10:13,592 --> 01:10:15,760
-Get him!
-Come on!

1039
01:10:24,603 --> 01:10:25,895
No, no!

1040
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:31,943
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1041
01:10:40,119 --> 01:10:41,828
Pig pile!

1042
01:11:03,893 --> 01:11:06,227
-Get outta that car!
-Move it!

1043
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:10,398
No! Please!
You don't understand!

1044
01:11:10,483 --> 01:11:12,525
Buzz is out there.
We gotta help him.

1045
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:14,944
-No!
-Toss him overboard!

1046
01:11:15,029 --> 01:11:16,780
No, no, no! Wait!

1047
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,785
-Hooray!
-So long, Woody!

1048
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:28,958
Oh! Woody!

1049
01:11:29,335 --> 01:11:32,337
-Oh! Well, thanks for the ride.
-Look out!

1050
01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:38,468
Now let's catch up
to that truck.

1051
01:11:45,851 --> 01:11:48,478
Guys! Guys! Woody's riding R.C.

1052
01:11:48,562 --> 01:11:50,688
-What?
-And Buzz is with him!

1053
01:11:54,985 --> 01:11:56,111
It is Buzz!

1054
01:11:56,195 --> 01:11:58,196
Woody was telling the truth.

1055
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:01,658
-What have we done?
-Great! Now I have guilt.

1056
01:12:01,742 --> 01:12:03,868
We're almost there!

1057
01:12:05,079 --> 01:12:07,288
Rocky, the ramp!

1058
01:12:15,047 --> 01:12:16,423
Look out!

1059
01:12:17,216 --> 01:12:19,592
Quick! Hold onto my tail!

1060
01:12:24,723 --> 01:12:29,727
-Attaboy, Slink!
-Oh! Woody!

1061
01:12:30,187 --> 01:12:31,146
Woody! Speed up!

1062
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:33,148
-Speed up!
-The batteries!

1063
01:12:33,232 --> 01:12:34,899
They're runnin' out!

1064
01:12:50,916 --> 01:12:55,211
-I can't hold on much longer.
-Slink! Hang on!

1065
01:13:10,978 --> 01:13:12,228
Great!

1066
01:13:15,065 --> 01:13:16,900
Woody! The rocket!

1067
01:13:16,984 --> 01:13:19,527
The match! Yes!

1068
01:13:19,612 --> 01:13:21,488
Thank you, Sid!

1069
01:13:28,621 --> 01:13:30,705
No! No, no! No!

1070
01:13:30,789 --> 01:13:34,292
No! Oh, no!

1071
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:38,213
No, no, no, no, no,

1072
01:13:38,297 --> 01:13:40,048
no!

1073
01:13:40,132 --> 01:13:41,841
No!

1074
01:13:50,809 --> 01:13:53,978
-Woody! What are you doing?
-Hold still, Buzz!

1075
01:13:56,607 --> 01:13:57,732
You did it!

1076
01:13:58,108 --> 01:13:59,692
Next stop, Andy!

1077
01:13:59,777 --> 01:14:03,863
Wait a minute. I just lit a rocket.
Rockets explode!

1078
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:16,918
I should have held on longer.

1079
01:14:17,002 --> 01:14:20,129
Look! Look! It's Woody
and Buzz comin' up fast!

1080
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,632
Woody!

1081
01:14:31,642 --> 01:14:33,101
Take cover!

1082
01:14:40,401 --> 01:14:42,527
This is the part
where we blow up!

1083
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:44,028
Not today!

1084
01:14:55,583 --> 01:14:57,792
Hey, Buzz!
You're flyin'!

1085
01:14:57,876 --> 01:15:01,170
This isn't flying.
This is falling with style.

1086
01:15:04,049 --> 01:15:08,136
To infinity and beyond!

1087
01:15:14,351 --> 01:15:16,394
Buzz, we missed the truck.

1088
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:18,563
We're not aiming for the truck.

1089
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:26,321
Hey, wow!

1090
01:15:26,405 --> 01:15:28,615
-What? What is it?
-Woody! Buzz!

1091
01:15:28,699 --> 01:15:30,700
Oh, great, you found them.
Where were they?

1092
01:15:30,784 --> 01:15:32,869
-Here in the car!
-See?

1093
01:15:32,953 --> 01:15:36,247
Now, what'd I tell you?
Right where you left 'em.

1094
01:15:44,923 --> 01:15:48,509
-Which one can I open first?
-Let's let Molly open one.

1095
01:15:54,391 --> 01:15:55,683
Frankincense, this is Myrrh.

1096
01:15:55,768 --> 01:15:58,102
Hey, heads up, everybody.
It's show time.

1097
01:15:58,187 --> 01:16:00,063
Whoa! It's time!

1098
01:16:02,107 --> 01:16:03,524
Oh, Bo.

1099
01:16:03,609 --> 01:16:06,027
There's got to be a less painful way
to get my attention.

1100
01:16:06,111 --> 01:16:08,196
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.

1101
01:16:09,323 --> 01:16:11,741
Say, isn't that mistletoe?

1102
01:16:14,244 --> 01:16:17,747
Maybe Andy will get another dinosaur.
Like a leaf eater.

1103
01:16:17,831 --> 01:16:21,209
That way I could play
the dominant predator.

1104
01:16:21,293 --> 01:16:22,335
Quiet, everyone! Quiet!

1105
01:16:22,419 --> 01:16:26,089
Molly's first present
is Mrs Potato Head.

1106
01:16:26,173 --> 01:16:28,216
Repeat, a Mrs Potato Head.

1107
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:30,385
Way to go, Idaho!

1108
01:16:30,469 --> 01:16:32,512
Gee, I'd better shave.

1109
01:16:37,226 --> 01:16:38,601
Come in, Frankincense.

1110
01:16:38,686 --> 01:16:40,687
Andy is now opening
his first present.

1111
01:16:40,771 --> 01:16:43,564
-It's...
-Buzz. Buzz Lightyear,

1112
01:16:43,649 --> 01:16:45,608
-you are not worried, are you?
-I can't quite...

1113
01:16:45,693 --> 01:16:47,110
-Me? No, no.
-Make out...

1114
01:16:47,194 --> 01:16:49,862
No. No, no, no, no.

1115
01:16:49,947 --> 01:16:52,281
A large box... It's...

1116
01:16:52,366 --> 01:16:54,951
-Are you?
-Now, Buzz,

1117
01:16:55,035 --> 01:16:59,288
what could Andy possibly get
that is worse than you?

1118
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:02,375
Oh, what is it? What is it?

1119
01:17:02,459 --> 01:17:04,377
Wow! A puppy!

1120
01:17:19,435 --> 01:17:22,687
You've got a friend in me

1121
01:17:23,981 --> 01:17:27,024
You've got a friend in me

1122
01:17:28,235 --> 01:17:31,404
When the road looks rough ahead

1123
01:17:31,488 --> 01:17:36,325
And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed

1124
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:39,829
You just remember
what your old pal said

1125
01:17:39,913 --> 01:17:42,707
Boy, you've got a friend in me

1126
01:17:44,209 --> 01:17:47,879
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

1127
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:56,262
You've got a friend in me

1128
01:17:57,473 --> 01:18:00,057
You've got a friend in me

1129
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:05,771
-You got troubles
-And I got 'em too

1130
01:18:05,856 --> 01:18:09,901
There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you

1131
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:12,987
If we stick together
we can see it through

1132
01:18:13,071 --> 01:18:16,407
'Cause you've got a friend in me

1133
01:18:18,243 --> 01:18:20,786
You've got a friend in me

1134
01:18:22,581 --> 01:18:26,584
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

1135
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:29,670
Bigger and stronger too

1136
01:18:29,755 --> 01:18:30,838
Maybe

1137
01:18:30,923 --> 01:18:36,552
But none of them will ever love you
the way I do

1138
01:18:36,637 --> 01:18:39,222
It's me and you, boy

1139
01:18:39,306 --> 01:18:42,725
And as the years go by

1140
01:18:42,809 --> 01:18:45,895
Our friendship will never die

1141
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:52,276
You're gonna see it's our destiny

1142
01:18:52,361 --> 01:18:56,322
You've got a friend in me

1143
01:18:56,406 --> 01:18:58,950
You've got a friend in me

1144
01:19:00,619 --> 01:20:41,177
You've got a friend in me
