1
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:24,373
Hear you now...

2
00:00:24,732 --> 00:00:26,978
...a story of good against evil.

3
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,226
An epoch that has its beginning
at an ending...

4
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,632
...and ends at a beginning.

5
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:36,563
Listen, as we speak of the fall
of a lord of darkness...

6
00:00:36,962 --> 00:00:39,207
...and the return of a king of light.

7
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:42,856
Concern yourselves
with armies and wizards...

8
00:00:43,297 --> 00:00:45,061
...phantoms and emperors...

9
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:49,352
...cloud-capped towers
and bloodied fields of horrendous carnage.

10
00:00:50,394 --> 00:00:51,918
Consider no less...

11
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:53,844
...than the cataclysmic transformation...

12
00:00:53,922 --> 00:00:56,609
...of that ancient world
of wonder and magic...

13
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:59,494
...to the world we know now, of Man.

14
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:03,505
What mighty lord, you may ask,
is hero enough...

15
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:06,672
...to evoke such cosmic metamorphosis?

16
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:12,485
Why, no lord at all,
but the littlest of fellows...

17
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,811
...Frodo the Hobbit...

18
00:01:14,892 --> 00:01:17,096
...and his faithful squire, Samwise.

19
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,587
Who, beginning at the ending,
now approach Rivendell...

20
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,874
...the Elvish home of Elrond...

21
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:27,159
...there to help celebrate
the 129th birthday...

22
00:01:27,723 --> 00:01:29,609
...of Frodo's aged kin...

23
00:01:30,168 --> 00:01:33,616
...Bilbo Baggins,
renowned tormentor of dragons.

24
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:39,269
Bless my soul!
You're a match for Smaug himself.

25
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:49,816
All of us, Frodo and Samwise...

26
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:53,103
...their Hobbit companions,
Merry and Pippin...

27
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:56,791
...EIrond the Elf-Lord, and l, Gandalf...

28
00:01:57,434 --> 00:01:59,638
...wished Bilbo only the best.

29
00:02:00,722 --> 00:02:03,086
But as we celebrated
far into the Elvish night...

30
00:02:03,126 --> 00:02:06,695
...we found it difficult
to keep our aging guest of honor awake.

31
00:02:07,696 --> 00:02:10,143
Nay, Pippin. Not till Bilbo has cut it.

32
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:13,510
Blast. What a time to fall asleep.

33
00:02:13,872 --> 00:02:15,355
Who's asleep?

34
00:02:15,596 --> 00:02:17,681
Just resting my eyes...

35
00:02:18,044 --> 00:02:20,128
...and remembering.

36
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,736
There And Back Again...

37
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,262
...and what happened after.

38
00:02:26,664 --> 00:02:28,026
Remembering, sir?

39
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:29,951
So many things.

40
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:31,876
Old Smaug...

41
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:34,240
...dear Thorin...

42
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,047
...that terrible Gollum chap...

43
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:40,014
...the Ring of Invisibility.

44
00:02:41,017 --> 00:02:42,981
What's become of my ring?

45
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:46,509
That ring I gave you and you took away.

46
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:48,152
Yes.

47
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:50,199
I've lost it, Bilbo dear.

48
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:51,803
I got rid of it, you know.

49
00:02:52,282 --> 00:02:55,732
Pity. I should have liked to see it again.

50
00:02:56,372 --> 00:02:57,375
But...

51
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:59,902
...now, how silly of me.

52
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:02,627
That's what you went for, wasn't it?

53
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:04,313
To get rid of it.

54
00:03:05,071 --> 00:03:10,045
But why destroy a thing
of such wondrous magic?

55
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:12,571
It was an evil thing, sir.

56
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:13,853
Nay!

57
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:15,779
Without its powers...

58
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:19,708
...I could never have faced
the worm, Smaug.

59
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,118
You unwittingly used its
evil forces for good, dear Uncle.

60
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:26,365
Your innocence protected you.

61
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:28,729
But had you continued to wear it...

62
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,498
...instead of keeping it
above your mantle as a trophy...

63
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:35,425
...its ever-growing malignancy
would have consumed you...

64
00:03:35,825 --> 00:03:40,758
...as it almost consumed Samwise and me
and the whole of Middle-earth.

65
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:44,528
But this is all so confusing.

66
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:48,134
So confusing.

67
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:52,466
-Will he never cut the cake?
-Patience, Merry.

68
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,312
Me for a good smoke, while we wait.

69
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:58,082
-What say, master?
-Good notion, Sam.

70
00:04:00,685 --> 00:04:02,770
Bless my soul!

71
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,942
You are missing a finger!

72
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:12,233
You not only lost my ring...

73
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:15,841
...you lost the finger on which it rode?

74
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:20,051
Frodo, you must explain.

75
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:22,337
We have brought with us someone...

76
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:25,343
...who has written a ballad
about the adventures of Frodo:

77
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:27,230
The Minstrel of Gondor.

78
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:33,605
"Frodo of the nine fingers

79
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:37,450
"And the Ring of Doom"

80
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,505
It has its beginnings two ages past...

81
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:46,794
...when Bilbo set forth to reclaim
the Dwarves' gold...

82
00:04:46,835 --> 00:04:48,919
...from the dragon, Smaug.

83
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:57,741
While on his quest,
Bilbo stumbled into a deep, dank cave.

84
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:02,192
This part I remember.

85
00:05:03,153 --> 00:05:06,962
"When Bilbo found that shiny ring

86
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,691
"In Gollum's cave of gloom

87
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:13,016
"He never thought

88
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:18,468
"That it would turn into a ring of doom

89
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:23,159
"The dragon Smaug
The spiders too

90
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,368
"The Goblins, the Elven-king

91
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:30,218
"They came to know the power

92
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:34,666
"Of the Hobbit and his ring

93
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:47,419
"Frodo of the nine fingers

94
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,348
"And the Ring of Doom

95
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:54,556
"It started with a Hobbit

96
00:05:55,236 --> 00:05:58,725
"In Gollum's cave of gloom

97
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:04,940
"The power of the Ring, it grew

98
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,226
"And Gandalf sat in thought

99
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:13,039
"He knew that it must be destroyed

100
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,247
"In fires where it was wrought

101
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:21,176
"For if in evil hands it fell

102
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:24,667
"The Earth would know its end

103
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:29,198
"No force of arms would win the day

104
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,765
"No army could contend"

105
00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:40,062
For evil flourished everywhere...

106
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,830
...and lay on the land
like a festering malignancy.

107
00:06:44,714 --> 00:06:46,437
There was one hope, though:

108
00:06:47,077 --> 00:06:49,443
In a distant land, the noble Aragorn...

109
00:06:49,562 --> 00:06:51,609
...heir to the empty throne of Gondor...

110
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:55,658
...awaited with a small band
to return and become king.

111
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,910
But he could not triumph
until the Ring was destroyed.

112
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,874
So went the prophecy.

113
00:07:02,998 --> 00:07:06,723
"Frodo of the nine fingers

114
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:09,651
"And the Ring of Doom

115
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:13,943
"Accepted a heavy burden

116
00:07:14,384 --> 00:07:17,631
"For the fires to consume"

117
00:07:22,403 --> 00:07:25,009
Frodo and his gallant
companion, Samwise...

118
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:27,374
...had many brave adventures...

119
00:07:27,735 --> 00:07:31,105
...until finally they reached
the rocky border of Mordor...

120
00:07:31,424 --> 00:07:33,950
...domain of the Black Lord, Sauron.

121
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,322
There, Frodo was captured and imprisoned
in the Tower of Cirith Ungol.

122
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:44,052
Samwise vowed to enter
the Orc-infested tower alone...

123
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:45,177
...to save him.

124
00:07:54,118 --> 00:07:56,041
The Ring of Doom was missing...

125
00:07:56,081 --> 00:07:57,606
...from 'round Frodo's neck!

126
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,978
"Frodo of the nine fingers

127
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,705
"And the Ring of Doom

128
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,633
"Why does he have nine fingers?

129
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:14,806
"Where is the Ring of Doom?"

130
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:41,070
One tiny Hobbit against all the evil
the world could muster.

131
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:44,196
A sane being would have given up.

132
00:08:44,676 --> 00:08:47,764
But Samwise burned
with a magnificent madness...

133
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:51,172
...a glowing obsession
to surmount every obstacle...

134
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,825
...to find Frodo, destroy the Ring,
and cleanse Middle-earth...

135
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:58,029
...of its festering malignancy.

136
00:09:00,196 --> 00:09:04,964
He knew he would try again,
fail perhaps and try once more...

137
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:08,653
...a thousand, thousand times, if need be.

138
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,380
But he would not give up the quest.

139
00:11:06,695 --> 00:11:09,219
You cannot die, Master Frodo!

140
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:12,107
I'll get to you somehow!

141
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,314
You. I can feel you
throbbing with excitement!

142
00:11:32,395 --> 00:11:37,205
You know the gates to the land
of Mordor and your dark lord, Sauron.

143
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,979
Now I must bear your loathsome weight.

144
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:48,272
But I do it for he who lies
in that accursed tower...

145
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,479
...Cirith Ungol:

146
00:11:51,322 --> 00:11:54,086
My sweet master, Frodo.

147
00:11:57,695 --> 00:11:59,419
And, 'tis Sting...

148
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,986
...Master Frodo's sword.

149
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:04,270
And his hero's cloak!

150
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:08,480
Lost 'em with the Ring
while doing battle, he did.

151
00:12:09,282 --> 00:12:12,731
They're safe with me
till I find you again, master!

152
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:16,379
He can't hear.

153
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:19,868
Half dead, behind walls of stone.

154
00:12:21,672 --> 00:12:25,360
Serve me, Sting, till I can return you.

155
00:12:30,655 --> 00:12:31,657
Here now.

156
00:12:32,056 --> 00:12:33,420
What's this?

157
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:36,909
Dank and foul-smelling...

158
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:39,554
...but it may be a way in.

159
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:53,387
I've got through!

160
00:12:54,832 --> 00:12:57,837
So I've finally crossed into Mordor.

161
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:07,782
Orcs in the tower!

162
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:11,229
Old Bilbo called them Goblins.

163
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:16,961
But whatever the name,
I loathe the vile creatures.

164
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:22,417
Fighting among themselves?

165
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:25,064
I could get in!

166
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:27,227
They wouldn't notice me!

167
00:13:30,636 --> 00:13:32,801
The Ring holds me back?

168
00:13:34,886 --> 00:13:35,886
True.

169
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:38,813
Once the Orcs saw me...

170
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:42,344
...they'd forget their own arguments
for the head of an enemy!

171
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,353
Useless to face such odds.

172
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,437
Don't take any chances.

173
00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:50,602
Destroy the thing yourself.

174
00:13:52,526 --> 00:13:54,611
I do it for you, Frodo!

175
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:57,380
I must be ring bearer now!

176
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,277
"The bearer of the Ring

177
00:14:05,358 --> 00:14:08,004
"The wearer of the Ring

178
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:13,256
"Stands on the very brink of fate

00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:18,789
"Staring into eyes of darkness and despair

180
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:22,959
"That rise and shrink with hate"

181
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:34,026
I can feel you change
as we draw near the great furnaces...

182
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:38,156
...where in the depths of time,
you were shaped and formed.

183
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:41,803
Mount Doom!

184
00:14:46,374 --> 00:14:49,543
I could claim you, Ring!

185
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:55,638
I would be Samwise the Strong!

186
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,007
"The bearer of the Ring

187
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:02,814
"The wearer of the Ring

00:15:02,895 --> 00:15:06,824
"He hears a voice compelling him

"Filling him with thoughts

"Beware who wears the Ring"

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,765
Hail Samwise the Strong!

206
00:16:24,206 --> 00:16:26,533
Hail the Conqueror!

207
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,898
Hail the War-King!

208
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,143
Hero of the Age!

209
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:34,070
To the Dark Tower!

210
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,115
To Barad-dur!

211
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:49,307
I claim thee, Barad-dur!

212
00:16:49,827 --> 00:16:52,635
You are Sauron's no more!

213
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:01,176
Hail Samwise the Strong!

214
00:17:01,776 --> 00:17:04,381
The sun shines for thee alone!

215
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:13,123
And now I claim all
of the Vale of Gorgoroth!

216
00:17:15,048 --> 00:17:18,336
Now let this foul desolation...

217
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,784
...this cursed plateau
of the Dark Lord, Sauron...

218
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:25,512
...this Orc-infested,
desert of nameless horrors...

219
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:29,562
...let it blossom forth, and live!

220
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:33,771
Let it live for Samwise the Strong!

221
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:39,064
Samwise the Strong!

222
00:17:50,411 --> 00:17:51,412
Behold!

223
00:17:53,257 --> 00:17:56,465
The gardens of my delight!

224
00:17:57,068 --> 00:18:01,277
So I shall transform the world!

225
00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:13,907
All could be mine...

226
00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:18,277
...if I but claim thee, Ring!

227
00:18:23,691 --> 00:18:24,732
No!

228
00:18:33,674 --> 00:18:35,477
What brought me back?

229
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:39,246
Plain Hobbit sense.

230
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,700
I know in my heart I'm not
enough to bear such a burden.

231
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:49,191
One small garden of a free gardener...

232
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:51,598
...is all my need and due.

233
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:54,565
My own hands to use...

234
00:18:55,404 --> 00:18:57,811
...not the hands of others to command.

235
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,005
No, such a quest is not for me.

236
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:22,331
Frodo lives.

237
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,538
And only he knows
how to destroy the Ring...

238
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,383
...in the Cracks of Doom.

239
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:29,548
Only he can find the fire.

240
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,757
Dear Master Frodo.

241
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,122
I will find you.

242
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:38,048
Somehow.

243
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:52,563
An ancient world of towered fortress cities.

244
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:54,286
Cirith Ungol...

245
00:20:54,366 --> 00:20:57,093
...guarding the entrance
to the lands of Mordor.

246
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:02,186
Barad-dur, palace of the Dark Lord, Sauron.

247
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,750
And now, look you to yet another.

248
00:21:05,993 --> 00:21:09,441
Minas-Tirith, chief city of Gondor...

249
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:13,211
...last bastion of hope
for the powers of light and good.

250
00:21:21,393 --> 00:21:26,002
From the battlement atop the citadel,
like a mariner in a mountainous ship...

251
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:30,492
...one could look sheer down
upon the gate 700 feet below.

252
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:33,420
And still this was not the top.

253
00:21:35,063 --> 00:21:37,668
Behold! The White Tower.

254
00:21:41,076 --> 00:21:45,247
At the top, the banner of the stewards
who governed the city...

255
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:49,497
...its silken arms embracing
a domain more fitting Gwaihir...

256
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:52,905
...Lord of the Eagles
than those whose emblem it bore.

257
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:57,476
All this, Minas-Tirith was.

258
00:22:00,684 --> 00:22:04,452
But now, under siege,
the sparkling gem of Gondor...

259
00:22:04,613 --> 00:22:08,060
...had become dull and flawed
with the hell of war.

260
00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:14,195
The once-lush fields of Pelennor,
now a wasted battleground...

261
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:19,206
...upon which Sauron's forces of evil
celebrated their victories.

262
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:30,635
Far superior in number
to the battle-ravaged Gondor forces...

263
00:22:30,995 --> 00:22:33,362
...they mounted their monster oliphaunts...

264
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:38,491
...to ride in the rocking, armored towers,
to their almost certain victory.

265
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:43,666
And in the heavens,
where no living thing dare now venture...

266
00:22:44,508 --> 00:22:49,478
...Sauron's phantom lieutenants,
the Nazgul, astride their devil steeds...

267
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:53,410
...scream battle cries
of vile encouragement.

268
00:23:10,168 --> 00:23:14,779
High in the White Tower, Lord Denethor,
Chief Steward of Gondor...

269
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:17,826
...his mind broken
as his city crumbled about him...

270
00:23:17,907 --> 00:23:20,835
...had succumbed
to an eerie fire of the brain...

271
00:23:20,874 --> 00:23:24,562
...and, in his madness,
ordered his own execution.

272
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:29,774
-You must stop him!
-His word is law!

273
00:23:29,895 --> 00:23:31,579
I'll find Gandalf!

274
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:37,432
The Hobbit, Pippin, who had proved
a most valuable assistant for me...

275
00:23:37,592 --> 00:23:39,439
...rushed to the battlement.

276
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,521
Where l, Gandalf...

277
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:45,332
...and the Gondor generals searched
the distance in vain...

278
00:23:45,811 --> 00:23:47,738
...for a sign of our rescuers.

279
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:49,983
For we awaited Theoden...

280
00:23:50,503 --> 00:23:53,631
...a valuable ally,
lord of the friendly nation of Rohan...

281
00:23:53,713 --> 00:23:58,204
...for whom we had dispatched
Pippin's Hobbit friend, little Merry...

282
00:23:59,325 --> 00:24:03,855
...to inform him of our perilous condition
and to beseech his aid.

283
00:24:03,936 --> 00:24:07,744
For we wondered, would he
and his armies come to our rescue?

284
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:12,677
Forward! To Minas-Tirith!

285
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:16,125
Forward!

286
00:24:18,851 --> 00:24:21,298
For only Theoden could save our city...

287
00:24:21,536 --> 00:24:24,224
...and make it safe
for the return of Aragorn.

288
00:24:24,785 --> 00:24:27,392
But we feared he would come too late.

289
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:34,087
-What? Denethor?
-He's gone loony, I tell you!

290
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:35,370
Come quickly.

291
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,103
You cannot do this!

292
00:24:42,346 --> 00:24:44,352
Soon all shall be burned.

293
00:24:45,314 --> 00:24:47,079
The West has failed.

294
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,288
It shall go up in a great fire...

295
00:24:51,368 --> 00:24:54,176
...and all shall be ended.

296
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:00,149
Ash and smoke blown away on the wind.

297
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,843
All shall not be ended.
Theoden's forces are on their way!

298
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:15,424
Pride and despair!

299
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:18,232
Pride and despair!

300
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:22,081
Didst thou think the eyes
of the White Tower were blind?

301
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:31,023
I have looked inside my palantir.

302
00:25:31,182 --> 00:25:35,150
-What is that?
-Palantir. The stuff of wizards.

303
00:25:35,591 --> 00:25:37,558
A crystal ball to see the future.

304
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:43,251
I have seen more than thou knowest,
gray fool.

305
00:25:43,891 --> 00:25:46,340
Thy hope is but ignorance.

306
00:25:47,543 --> 00:25:51,552
Even with the forces of Theoden,
there is no hope.

307
00:25:51,671 --> 00:25:54,117
Go forth and fight!

308
00:25:55,118 --> 00:25:56,321
Vanity!

309
00:25:57,044 --> 00:26:00,693
For a little space you may triumph
on the field...

310
00:26:00,773 --> 00:26:02,417
...for a day.

311
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:08,270
But against the dark power...

312
00:26:08,351 --> 00:26:11,919
...that now rises, there is no victory.

313
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,930
To this dying city,
only the first fingers of its hand...

314
00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:18,774
...have yet been stretched.

315
00:26:19,697 --> 00:26:23,628
All the East is moving!

316
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:29,402
And even now,
the wind of thy hope cheats thee...

317
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:34,372
...and wafts up an enemy fleet
with black sails.

318
00:26:35,215 --> 00:26:40,184
Up the Great River, Anduin they come,
even now.

319
00:26:40,546 --> 00:26:43,355
The river which leads to the edge...

320
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:45,920
...of the Pelennor Fields.

321
00:26:51,813 --> 00:26:54,902
A black fleet? A devil's armada?

322
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:58,831
-Do those palantir things ever lie?
-Never!

323
00:27:01,477 --> 00:27:03,843
The West has failed!

324
00:27:04,443 --> 00:27:07,530
It is time for all to depart this life...

325
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:10,175
...who would not be slaves!

326
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:14,707
Servants, come hither!

327
00:27:21,003 --> 00:27:24,653
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

328
00:27:25,214 --> 00:27:28,100
And so pass also the days of Gondor.

329
00:27:28,862 --> 00:27:31,669
For good or evil they have ended.

330
00:27:34,915 --> 00:27:36,840
You must take charge, Gandalf.

331
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,844
You must lead our forces now...

332
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:42,053
...until Aragorn returns
to claim the throne of Gondor.

333
00:27:42,132 --> 00:27:43,415
If he returns.

334
00:27:43,937 --> 00:27:44,900
Gandalf, you...

335
00:27:45,138 --> 00:27:48,987
I saw the vision in the palantir.
A dark fleet.

336
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:51,515
-ls there no hope?
-None.

337
00:27:51,997 --> 00:27:53,923
Unless the Ring be destroyed.

338
00:27:54,763 --> 00:27:57,690
But alas, it is lost with its bearer, Frodo.

339
00:27:58,295 --> 00:27:59,413
All is gone.

340
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,624
l, Gandalf was without hope.

341
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:07,313
For I did not know
that at that very moment...

342
00:28:07,471 --> 00:28:09,678
...at that other towered fortress...

343
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,364
...the future of all good in the world...

344
00:28:12,405 --> 00:28:15,973
...rested upon the wits
and the tiny shoulders...

345
00:28:16,212 --> 00:28:18,339
...of poor little Samwise...

346
00:28:19,301 --> 00:28:21,466
...who, still undetected
by the Orcs within...

347
00:28:21,548 --> 00:28:25,115
...approached the gates
of the Tower of Cirith Ungol.

348
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,324
But to get through those gates...

349
00:28:28,404 --> 00:28:31,652
...he would have to pass
the Two Watchers.

350
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:39,708
Though carved
from huge blocks of solid stone...

351
00:28:40,271 --> 00:28:43,718
...some dreadful spirit of evil vigilance
abode in them...

352
00:28:44,402 --> 00:28:46,364
...and they were aware.

353
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:56,348
My imagination's running away with me.

354
00:28:57,513 --> 00:29:00,760
They're made of stone.
What harm can they do?

355
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:07,736
Don't get too cocky, Samwise.

356
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:12,907
Orcs aren't made of stone,
and they have ears.

357
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,917
Though where the blazes are they?

358
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:20,124
I thought the tower was full of them.

359
00:29:23,132 --> 00:29:25,177
But they give me the shivers.

360
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,591
Forget about them.
Get past as quick as I can!

361
00:29:37,728 --> 00:29:39,692
Bless my soul.

362
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:44,303
Like some invisible gate.

363
00:29:46,107 --> 00:29:48,633
That's how the Watchers keep guard.

364
00:29:50,758 --> 00:29:51,920
Blast!

365
00:29:52,202 --> 00:29:57,013
How do I get through, or climb over,
or under something I can't see?

366
00:29:58,698 --> 00:29:59,738
How?

367
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,903
Ouch!

368
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:03,908
Something's burning me.

369
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:09,242
What's this? A phial?

370
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:15,176
And what magic is in it
to make it glow so?

371
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,478
They're opening up!

372
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:29,852
Thank you, old boys.

373
00:30:30,693 --> 00:30:33,059
It was bad manners you showed me before.

374
00:30:36,024 --> 00:30:37,549
Handy, this thing.

375
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,460
An alarm! That's done it.

376
00:31:03,972 --> 00:31:05,856
I'm ready for you.

377
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:10,988
Tell your captains
that a great Elf warrior has called...

378
00:31:11,068 --> 00:31:12,793
...with his Elf blade!

379
00:31:21,693 --> 00:31:23,577
They're all dead.

380
00:31:25,062 --> 00:31:26,065
Why?

381
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:29,913
The tower was crawling
with them just a few hours ago.

382
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,045
Looks like they were
fighting among themselves.

383
00:31:35,084 --> 00:31:36,568
But what for?

384
00:31:38,453 --> 00:31:41,779
There's a lot less of you left
to attack Minas-Tirith!

385
00:31:42,703 --> 00:31:44,747
Goodbye and good riddance!

386
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:53,289
The whole tower climbs backwards-like.

387
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,336
I'll follow these lights.

388
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:05,717
This must be the entrance to the top tier.

389
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,166
Frodo can't be far away.

390
00:32:18,026 --> 00:32:20,633
An Orc! They're not all dead!

391
00:32:21,796 --> 00:32:25,163
Kill him! Bone him! Boil him!

392
00:32:25,604 --> 00:32:27,971
There's a sweet one for you!

393
00:32:28,855 --> 00:32:30,697
Split him in two!

394
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:34,305
Can't let him have the Ring!

395
00:32:47,537 --> 00:32:48,540
No!

396
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:57,122
What the blazes made him do that?

397
00:32:57,963 --> 00:32:59,044
Come back here!

398
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:02,813
No!

399
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,303
The great Elf warrior is loose! Stop.

400
00:33:08,867 --> 00:33:11,272
Stop, or I'll skin you alive!

401
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,447
Mercy!

402
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:19,853
I'll think about it!
I have some questions, filthy one.

403
00:33:19,934 --> 00:33:22,382
Yes? I'll tell you anything.

404
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,866
The Hobbit, Frodo, is he still alive?

405
00:33:25,267 --> 00:33:28,593
If anything still lives here, he does.

406
00:33:28,836 --> 00:33:31,723
What happened here?
Why all this carnage?

407
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:36,613
Our captains made battle
and ordered us to fight also.

408
00:33:36,693 --> 00:33:38,296
What was in contest?

409
00:33:38,657 --> 00:33:40,984
The Hobbit's pretty coat...

410
00:33:41,223 --> 00:33:44,551
...when he reveals its hiding place.

411
00:33:45,155 --> 00:33:48,642
You killed each other
for that blasted cloak?

412
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:51,810
Well, I have it! Not Frodo.

413
00:33:52,812 --> 00:33:53,775
You?

414
00:33:54,456 --> 00:33:56,702
You're just a Hobbit.

415
00:33:57,141 --> 00:33:59,306
-Give me the coat.
-Get back!

416
00:34:11,896 --> 00:34:14,622
This must be the top.

417
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,193
Anything above?

418
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,239
Yes.

419
00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:24,606
There is something!

420
00:34:29,376 --> 00:34:30,820
Frodo!

421
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,965
Stop that, you pig!

422
00:34:59,529 --> 00:35:00,693
Frodo.

423
00:35:01,535 --> 00:35:04,180
Dear master. Frodo.

424
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:07,027
You live.

425
00:35:07,868 --> 00:35:09,832
You live!

426
00:35:10,795 --> 00:35:14,444
-Am I still dreaming?
-No dream, master.

427
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:17,810
It's real. I've come.

428
00:35:18,694 --> 00:35:21,784
Sam. Dear Sam.

429
00:35:23,426 --> 00:35:26,634
I feel like a child at rest.

430
00:35:27,397 --> 00:35:29,441
When night fears are driven away.

431
00:35:30,204 --> 00:35:33,849
By some loved voice.

432
00:35:35,453 --> 00:35:37,097
Come, Mr. Frodo.

433
00:35:37,818 --> 00:35:40,507
I still must get you out of this place.

434
00:35:41,187 --> 00:35:44,558
Please, dear master, wake up.

435
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,683
They hovered over me.

436
00:35:48,285 --> 00:35:51,491
Gloating, fingering their knives.

437
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:54,378
The whips, their claws, their eyes...

438
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:56,545
Don't think about it.

439
00:35:57,065 --> 00:35:59,072
Let me help you to your feet.

440
00:36:00,273 --> 00:36:02,917
Oh, dear. The quest.

441
00:36:02,957 --> 00:36:05,085
The quest has failed.

442
00:36:05,524 --> 00:36:07,972
Failed? No, sir.

443
00:36:08,651 --> 00:36:11,699
Yes. The Ring is gone, dear Sam.

444
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:16,471
Even if we could get out of here,
we can't escape.

445
00:36:17,153 --> 00:36:19,759
For evil is everywhere.

446
00:36:20,521 --> 00:36:23,166
And only Elves can escape Middle-earth.

447
00:36:23,927 --> 00:36:26,537
They board the white ships
at the Gray Havens...

448
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:30,064
...and sail off to the lands beyond.

449
00:36:57,767 --> 00:37:00,255
Don't even think of passing on!

450
00:37:00,536 --> 00:37:02,941
The quest has not failed, master!

451
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,472
You don't understand.
The Orcs took everything!

452
00:37:07,831 --> 00:37:10,719
Not everything. Look.

453
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:15,371
You've got it? You've got it here?

454
00:37:15,492 --> 00:37:18,579
You must have lost it in the struggle.
I found it.

455
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,465
Samwise, you are a marvel!

456
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,590
I'll keep it 'round my neck...

457
00:37:23,631 --> 00:37:26,597
...for it's too heavy
for you to bear in your condition.

458
00:37:30,527 --> 00:37:34,136
Give it to me at once! You can't have it!

459
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,782
All right, Mr. Frodo. Here it is.

460
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:44,961
"Beware the power
is a power never known

461
00:37:45,403 --> 00:37:50,333
"Beware the power that was simple
now has grown

462
00:37:51,014 --> 00:37:53,261
"Beware"

463
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:04,004
You filthy, slimy thief!

464
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:07,774
-I have the power now.
-Master, no.

465
00:38:08,095 --> 00:38:10,541
Don't say such things. Please don't.

466
00:38:11,021 --> 00:38:13,028
It's the Ring.

467
00:38:15,312 --> 00:38:20,005
Sam. What have I said?
What have I done? Forgive me.

468
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:23,854
I'd forgotten its malevolent trickery.

469
00:38:24,575 --> 00:38:27,262
I'm fine now. Fine. Sam, forgive me.

470
00:38:28,143 --> 00:38:30,390
I must carry the burden to the end.

471
00:38:30,429 --> 00:38:32,916
It can't be altered.
You can't come between...

472
00:38:32,995 --> 00:38:34,921
...me and this doom.

473
00:38:35,518 --> 00:38:39,490
As you wish, master.
I also have found Sting.

474
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:43,019
Might I keep it with me a little longer?

475
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,270
I have the strength to use it.
And you, with your wound and all...

476
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:50,518
Yes, of course, dear Sam.

477
00:38:51,438 --> 00:38:53,244
And your cloak which I wear.

478
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:56,131
In a pocket I found this.

479
00:38:57,132 --> 00:39:00,823
It has powers.
It got me past the Watchers. What is it?

480
00:39:01,183 --> 00:39:04,468
The Phial of Galadriel! I can say no more.

481
00:39:04,951 --> 00:39:09,041
If I betray the trust and give the secret,
its powers will die.

482
00:39:09,563 --> 00:39:14,012
-I understand.
-But now we must get out of here quickly.

483
00:39:18,782 --> 00:39:22,553
I know the chain mail's heavy for you.
But we may need it.

484
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:27,164
And I can't leave anything behind,
so I'll wear the Orc garb over my own.

485
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:34,141
Don't we make a fine, matching pair.
Now, off to Mount Doom.

486
00:39:35,181 --> 00:39:37,829
Hope you've made inquiries
about inns along the road?

487
00:39:38,511 --> 00:39:41,156
-lnns, master?
-For food and drink.

488
00:39:41,637 --> 00:39:43,963
Only the best for two fine Orcs.

489
00:39:44,363 --> 00:39:47,491
There's nothing, master,
and you know it well.

490
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:52,104
Save for the few crumbs of cake
and drops of water left in my pack.

491
00:39:52,185 --> 00:39:55,831
Courage, Sam. That's enough to start on.

492
00:39:56,071 --> 00:39:59,961
The food we might manage,
but the water's going to be bad business.

493
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:01,725
We'll make it.

494
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:05,452
But we'd best start,
or a whole lake of it won't do us any good!

495
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:11,588
No, I'm all right. It's the mail.

496
00:40:11,669 --> 00:40:13,994
I'll get used to it. Come.

497
00:40:22,577 --> 00:40:26,906
I'm going to faint, Sam.
I don't know what's come over me.

498
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:31,236
It's that invisible gate.
There's some devilry there.

499
00:40:31,918 --> 00:40:33,520
But I got through once.

500
00:40:35,205 --> 00:40:36,567
Now for it!

501
00:40:43,946 --> 00:40:45,789
It's still there!

502
00:40:46,351 --> 00:40:47,834
This is not working.

503
00:40:47,955 --> 00:40:51,563
They were expecting it!
Their will is strong.

504
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:54,011
It needs helping.

505
00:41:00,264 --> 00:41:02,790
We've broken the Watchers' will!

506
00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:32,261
We've still a chance, Samwise.

507
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,869
There's still a chance to destroy the Ring.

508
00:41:54,434 --> 00:41:59,286
-A Black Rider. The Nazgul.
-Run, Mr. Frodo.

509
00:41:59,566 --> 00:42:02,050
Not that way! There's a drop, follow me.

510
00:42:20,335 --> 00:42:21,939
Careful, Mr. Frodo.

511
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:26,869
I can't. Not another step.

512
00:42:27,231 --> 00:42:29,316
We must keep going, master.

513
00:42:29,677 --> 00:42:32,043
The Nazgul is in charge of the Tower now!

514
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:34,848
A Black Rider is not
so easy to fool as the Orcs.

515
00:42:35,168 --> 00:42:37,814
Just give me a moment.

516
00:42:38,214 --> 00:42:41,143
Begging your pardon, sir,
but there's no time.

517
00:42:41,785 --> 00:42:44,432
Listen as the foul flying demon...

518
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:46,836
...gives alarm
to the whole Vale of Gorgoroth!

519
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:50,688
He's rallying the dark forces
to defend the Tower.

520
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:54,054
Soon they'll be upon us.
We've got to get away and hide!

521
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:57,101
Yes, of course, dear Sam.

522
00:43:02,476 --> 00:43:03,477
Listen.

523
00:43:05,921 --> 00:43:10,132
We'd best get across the bridge,
while we've still time.

524
00:43:15,744 --> 00:43:20,676
If Sauron himself was to offer me
a glass of water, I'd shake his hand.

525
00:43:21,439 --> 00:43:25,249
Don't say such things.
It only makes it worse.

526
00:43:27,534 --> 00:43:28,535
Sam.

527
00:43:30,101 --> 00:43:33,667
A spot of dizziness there. I'm sorry.

528
00:43:35,472 --> 00:43:39,723
'Tis a long time, Mr. Frodo,
since I had a proper sleep.

529
00:43:40,322 --> 00:43:43,211
Come, Sam, we shall support each other.

530
00:43:47,702 --> 00:43:49,708
It's no good, Sam.

531
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:53,837
I can't manage
the weight of this mail shirt.

532
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:58,165
It's of no use anyway.
We shall never get through by fighting.

533
00:43:58,768 --> 00:44:00,691
We may have some to do.

534
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:04,460
We won't take on armies.

535
00:44:04,864 --> 00:44:07,708
Who knows
what's down here in this canyon...

536
00:44:08,149 --> 00:44:09,632
...slithering behind the rocks?

537
00:44:10,755 --> 00:44:12,919
No, Sam, it must go.

538
00:44:13,601 --> 00:44:16,770
What about that Gollum creature,
for instance?

539
00:44:17,732 --> 00:44:21,659
The Gollum isn't dead,
and he's still after that ring!

540
00:44:22,946 --> 00:44:26,073
I'd hate to think of you
with naught but a bit of leather...

541
00:44:26,113 --> 00:44:28,639
...between you and a stab in the dark.

542
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:34,732
This hellish Mordor.

543
00:44:34,813 --> 00:44:37,780
First it sears you, then it freezes you.

544
00:44:38,623 --> 00:44:39,986
Mr. Frodo...

545
00:44:40,026 --> 00:44:43,553
...maybe we could rest just a little.

546
00:44:44,356 --> 00:44:48,445
My eyes are fair closing by themselves.

547
00:44:48,525 --> 00:44:49,648
Not here.

548
00:44:49,848 --> 00:44:51,333
I didn't want to say anything...

549
00:44:51,412 --> 00:44:55,662
...but there's a black rider,
a Nazgul, over us.

550
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:58,791
I can feel it. We must keep moving.

551
00:45:17,113 --> 00:45:22,085
Only a little more
to climb out of the canyon.

552
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:25,613
Then we'll take a look...

553
00:45:26,094 --> 00:45:30,265
...and see what the Vale of Gorgoroth
holds for us.

554
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,880
I told you, you'd see it, Mr. Frodo.

555
00:45:38,204 --> 00:45:40,086
Just look at it.

556
00:45:43,736 --> 00:45:45,981
God help us.

557
00:45:48,266 --> 00:45:51,715
Behold Gorgoroth!

558
00:45:54,361 --> 00:45:56,767
I don't like the looks of things at all.

559
00:45:57,048 --> 00:45:58,811
Pretty hopeless, I call it.

560
00:45:58,891 --> 00:46:03,302
Yes. And these dark armies
are not only of Orcs.

561
00:46:03,663 --> 00:46:05,306
There are Men, too!

562
00:46:05,988 --> 00:46:10,559
We just can't cross all that open country
crawling with enemies.

563
00:46:10,841 --> 00:46:14,127
Still, Sam, we shall have to try.

564
00:46:49,732 --> 00:46:51,777
It's no worse than I expected.

565
00:46:52,298 --> 00:46:54,262
I never hoped to get across...

566
00:46:54,343 --> 00:46:57,310
...but I've got to do the best I can.

567
00:47:02,683 --> 00:47:05,532
I think we can make it
to the next boulder, master.

568
00:47:05,609 --> 00:47:06,973
No one is about.

569
00:47:07,654 --> 00:47:09,298
Blasted moonlight.

570
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:13,388
Traveling by night's
almost as bad as by day.

571
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:16,075
Come now, sir. I'll help.

572
00:47:20,647 --> 00:47:22,572
Got to rest.

573
00:47:23,893 --> 00:47:27,022
If you please, sir. Me too.

574
00:47:29,147 --> 00:47:30,910
Just for a few minutes.

575
00:47:44,264 --> 00:47:45,786
"Where there's a whip

576

-What is it?
-Now we've gone and done it.

Slept through till daylight.

609
00:49:26,824 --> 00:49:30,553
With only this fool rock between us
and them armies.

610
00:49:31,114 --> 00:49:32,118
Look out.

611
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,969
What have we here? Two deserters?

612
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:39,535
Up with you! Get in line!

613
00:49:39,815 --> 00:49:41,017
We're in luck.

614
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:43,103
-He thinks we're Orcs.
-Luck?

615
00:49:44,145 --> 00:49:48,556
Good sir, we're gonna be marching
with the whole blinking army...

616
00:49:48,636 --> 00:49:51,242
...back to Cirith Ungol
where we started from!

617
00:49:52,445 --> 00:49:54,170
Come on, you slugs!

618
00:49:57,457 --> 00:49:58,779
"Where's there's a whip

623
00:50:19,469 --> 00:50:22,034
I can't continue.

624
00:50:22,597 --> 00:50:25,886
I'd rather be singing
a good old Hobbit song myself.

625
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:39,356
At least they gave us
provisions for our packs.

626
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:42,805
But Orc food is enough
to turn a rodent sick.

627
00:50:42,885 --> 00:50:45,652
Samwise, we have got to break ranks.

628
00:50:45,692 --> 00:50:47,817
Not while old whipper there is watching.

629
00:50:48,056 --> 00:50:51,264
Don't worry, master.
The opportunity will come.

630
00:50:55,233 --> 00:50:56,237
Halt.

631
00:50:56,836 --> 00:50:58,722
What do you mean, "halt"?

632
00:50:59,043 --> 00:51:02,489
I have a battalion of Men
to move across your road.

633
00:51:02,972 --> 00:51:06,901
Well I've got a battalion of Orcs
to move across yours.

634
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,025
You wait!

635
00:51:08,344 --> 00:51:11,191
Men come before Orcs. Get back.

636
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:14,680
I think this is it! You stay right here, sir.

637
00:51:16,885 --> 00:51:18,811
You going to stand for that, sir?

638
00:51:19,812 --> 00:51:21,375
Get back in line!

639
00:51:21,455 --> 00:51:26,388
You mean you're going to let a pack
of filthy Man-creatures go before us?

640
00:51:29,196 --> 00:51:31,721
And you call yourself an Orc?

641
00:51:33,765 --> 00:51:34,968
You're right.

642
00:51:37,535 --> 00:51:42,545
Kill them, bone them, cut them to bits!

643
00:51:43,949 --> 00:51:46,115
Smash them, bash them!

644
00:51:47,196 --> 00:51:48,559
Skin them alive!

645
00:52:12,538 --> 00:52:13,899
Not an inch.

646
00:52:14,302 --> 00:52:17,028
Not an inch further can I move.

647
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,592
Come, Mr. Frodo.

648
00:52:20,475 --> 00:52:25,487
One more crawl and then you can lie still.

649
00:52:27,412 --> 00:52:29,177
A bit further.

650
00:52:30,339 --> 00:52:32,144
This way, sir.

651
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:37,959
No use. Going to die. Can't see a thing.

652
00:52:39,561 --> 00:52:40,923
Mr. Frodo.

653
00:52:48,782 --> 00:52:50,426
Don't die, Mr. Frodo.

654
00:52:51,028 --> 00:52:54,234
You can't die. Please, master.

655
00:52:55,959 --> 00:53:00,170
If any power of good can hear us
in this accursed land...

656
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:02,014
...give us help.

657
00:53:02,494 --> 00:53:04,020
Help us.

658
00:53:14,122 --> 00:53:15,327
Power of good?

659
00:53:16,287 --> 00:53:20,177
Indeed, was there none left
in all Middle-earth...

660
00:53:20,258 --> 00:53:23,385
...with strength to aid our dying cause?

661
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:30,162
At that moment, the forces of darkness
made ready to break the main gate...

662
00:53:30,323 --> 00:53:33,929
...with a mighty battering ram
which they had named Grond.

663
00:53:38,421 --> 00:53:41,869
Long had it been forging
in the dark smithies of Mordor...

664
00:53:42,591 --> 00:53:44,636
...and on it spells of ruin lay.

665
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:59,712
-The gate will never stand up to that thing!
-Like the arm of the devil himself!

666
00:54:01,074 --> 00:54:03,919
When the gates break
I shall be there to greet it!

667
00:54:04,403 --> 00:54:06,967
Have my steed, Shadowfax, made ready!

668
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:09,977
-Farewell, Pippin.
-I go with you, sir.

669
00:54:10,176 --> 00:54:14,025
Then we leave this life together.
Come, little one.

670
00:54:26,453 --> 00:54:28,019
On, Shadowfax!

671
00:54:46,542 --> 00:54:48,265
The Lord of the Nazgul...

672
00:54:48,506 --> 00:54:50,712
...Sauron's second-in-command.

673
00:54:51,073 --> 00:54:53,238
A creature of the super-natural...

674
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,846
...and so no living Man could hinder him...

675
00:54:57,368 --> 00:54:59,572
...nor bring him harm in any way.

676
00:55:00,135 --> 00:55:02,619
He was invulnerable!

677
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:59,075
You cannot enter here!

678
00:55:59,958 --> 00:56:02,602
Go back to the abyss prepared for you!

679
00:56:02,923 --> 00:56:07,935
Go back! Fall to the nothingness
that awaits you and your master. Go!

680
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:18,120
Old fool!

681
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:21,365
This is my hour.

682
00:56:21,968 --> 00:56:25,657
Do you not know Death when you see it?

683
00:56:26,098 --> 00:56:30,227
Die now and curse in vain!

684
00:56:39,409 --> 00:56:43,900
And, as from some courtyard of the city,
a cock crowed...

685
00:56:44,341 --> 00:56:46,426
...recking nothing of wizardry or war...

686
00:56:47,026 --> 00:56:48,991
...welcoming only the morning...

687
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:52,000
...that in the sky far above
the shadows of death...

688
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,964
...was coming with the dawn.

689
00:56:54,966 --> 00:56:58,855
For as if in answer there came
from far away, another note.

690
00:57:02,624 --> 00:57:04,668
Horns! Horns! Horns!

691
00:57:04,749 --> 00:57:07,998
Over the fields of Pelennor,
they echoed from the distance.

692
00:57:08,237 --> 00:57:11,204
Great horns in the north, wildly blowing.

693
00:57:11,645 --> 00:57:16,096
Theoden and the rescuing arms of Rohan
had come at last.

694
00:57:28,568 --> 00:57:31,575
Ride now.

695
00:57:31,855 --> 00:57:33,577
Ride now, to Gondor.

696
00:57:36,344 --> 00:57:38,990
Victory was slipping
from the grasp of evil...

697
00:57:39,431 --> 00:57:42,238
...even as he stretched
out his hand to seize it.

698
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,725
And the strength of goodness
began to be felt once more...

699
00:57:46,168 --> 00:57:48,253
...throughout the lands.

700
00:57:50,899 --> 00:57:52,983
Had a prayer been answered?

701
00:57:53,906 --> 00:57:55,871
Water. Give me water.

702
00:57:56,593 --> 00:57:58,676
Master! Thank heaven!

703
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:01,124
Here, not too much now.

704
00:58:02,044 --> 00:58:03,850
Not all at once.

705
00:58:06,737 --> 00:58:08,019
He's weakening.

706
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,869
I feel it. Sauron is weakening.

707
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,556
But he is still in command.

708
00:58:15,197 --> 00:58:18,605
His arm is long, and it wields great power.

709
00:58:19,125 --> 00:58:22,132
No, master. You must rest.

710
00:58:22,453 --> 00:58:24,700
I must still destroy the Ring.

711
00:58:25,141 --> 00:58:27,345
I've more of a chance now...

712
00:58:27,786 --> 00:58:30,914
...but there's still such a long way to go.

713
00:58:31,076 --> 00:58:35,524
That's tomorrow, Mr. Frodo, tomorrow.

714
01:00:28,953 --> 01:00:32,161
And as the battle raged anew
on the fields of Pelennor...

715
01:00:32,401 --> 01:00:35,970
...the carnage continuing endlessly
through the days and nights...

716
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:41,023
...the real victory still lay
in the hands of Frodo and Samwise...

717
01:00:41,222 --> 01:00:44,189
...and the terrible weight
they bore closer and closer...

718
01:00:44,269 --> 01:00:46,917
...to the destruction,
which was our only hope.

719
01:00:51,006 --> 01:00:53,291
And finally, almost dead...

720
01:00:53,813 --> 01:00:56,898
...without fully realizing
they had reached the roots...

721
01:00:57,141 --> 01:01:00,629
...of the accursed Mount Doom.

722
01:01:01,831 --> 01:01:04,357
Come, Sam. Dear Sam.

723
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,446
For the rest of the way we shall crawl.

724
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:11,816
And so foot by foot...

725
01:01:12,094 --> 01:01:14,581
...like small gray insects...

726
01:01:14,621 --> 01:01:16,067
...they crept up the slope...

727
01:01:16,145 --> 01:01:19,193
...ever closer to that which lay
inside the mountain...

728
01:01:20,315 --> 01:01:23,362
...the fire, and the Cracks of Doom.

729
01:01:30,619 --> 01:01:32,905
"Doom

730
01:01:33,668 --> 01:01:37,715
"The Cracks of Doom

731
01:01:37,955 --> 01:01:41,966
"The chambers of fire

732
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:47,178
"The fires of doom "

733
01:01:52,189 --> 01:01:54,996
Who causes the minutes to fall dead...

734
01:01:55,558 --> 01:01:58,044
...adding up to no passing hour...

735
01:01:58,646 --> 01:02:01,010
...bringing no change from day to night...

736
01:02:01,332 --> 01:02:06,143
...as the unseen sun fails to filter
into the ever-present shadows?

737
01:02:06,704 --> 01:02:11,595
Who is this dark lord who turns
starless nights into sunless days?

738
01:02:12,237 --> 01:02:15,765
How does his piercing eye
see through the ever-present darkness?

739
01:02:16,327 --> 01:02:18,412
Seeing all and nothing.

740
01:02:19,657 --> 01:02:23,103
The Restless Eye, in his dark tower...

741
01:02:23,343 --> 01:02:27,796
...wearing a veil of protective shadow
he has woven from fear.

742
01:02:28,757 --> 01:02:31,285
And yet he fears, too.

743
01:02:31,723 --> 01:02:34,330
In the security of his protective realm...

744
01:02:34,609 --> 01:02:38,137
...he fears the winds of the world
are turning against him.

745
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:41,546
Tearing aside his veils and troubling him...

746
01:02:41,867 --> 01:02:46,878
...with tidings of bold spies
that have passed through his fences.

747
01:02:52,413 --> 01:02:54,699
"Doom

748
01:02:55,419 --> 01:02:59,591
"The Cracks of Doom

749
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:03,639
"The chambers of fire

750
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:09,051
"The fires of doom "

751
01:03:17,033 --> 01:03:21,160
-Did you see when the clouds parted?
-Yes.

752
01:03:21,242 --> 01:03:22,646
He's spotted us!

753
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:25,974
It's all up, or will soon be.

754
01:03:26,174 --> 01:03:28,018
This is the end of ends!

755
01:03:29,022 --> 01:03:31,506
Still have a chance.

756
01:03:32,546 --> 01:03:35,675
Bless you, sir, for your bravery!

757
01:03:36,557 --> 01:03:38,362
Give me the strength.

758
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:43,814
I ask you:
Give me the strength to try once more.

759
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:03,861
Wicked master.

760
01:04:04,664 --> 01:04:07,670
-God help us.
-Gollum.

761
01:04:08,072 --> 01:04:10,197
Wicked master cheats us.

762
01:04:12,883 --> 01:04:14,889
He mustn't go that way!

763
01:04:15,569 --> 01:04:18,658
He mustn't hurt Precious.

764
01:04:18,977 --> 01:04:21,142
Away, you scum.

765
01:04:21,223 --> 01:04:22,786
What do you want of us?

766
01:04:22,868 --> 01:04:26,155
Give it to Gollum, yes, give it to us!

767
01:04:28,279 --> 01:04:30,324
Give it to us!

768
01:04:44,999 --> 01:04:48,046
My Precious, my ring.

769
01:04:48,126 --> 01:04:51,175
Soon it will be mine...

770
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:54,623
...all mine!

771
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:58,753
Precious, my Precious.

772
01:04:59,554 --> 01:05:00,717
Precious.

773
01:05:34,115 --> 01:05:37,043
Precious is mine.

774
01:05:46,145 --> 01:05:49,151
You foul, reeking scum!

775
01:05:49,392 --> 01:05:50,875
I'll kill you!

776
01:05:54,245 --> 01:05:57,372
I can't strike! I may hit Mr. Frodo.

777
01:05:57,412 --> 01:06:00,538
Let me get hold of the Ring.

778
01:06:12,045 --> 01:06:14,893
"The bearer of the Ring

779
01:06:14,932 --> 01:06:17,138
"The wearer of the Ring

780
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:22,351
"Stands on the very brink of fate

781
01:06:22,992 --> 01:06:28,125
"Staring into eyes of darkness and despair

782
01:06:28,245 --> 01:06:33,258
"That rise and shrink with hate"

783
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,706
Be gone and trouble me no more!

784
01:06:38,309 --> 01:06:40,232
If you touch me ever again...

785
01:06:40,312 --> 01:06:44,363
...you shall be cast, yourself,
into the Fire of Doom.

786
01:06:49,855 --> 01:06:51,860
Look out! He'll spring again.

787
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:56,232
Quick, master, no time to lose.
Go on! I'll deal with him!

788
01:07:03,046 --> 01:07:05,332
Now I can deal with you!

789
01:07:06,374 --> 01:07:09,903
Don't kill us. Don't hurt us.

790
01:07:11,145 --> 01:07:13,552
Let us live, please.

791
01:07:13,633 --> 01:07:18,524
Let us live, just a little longer.

792
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:21,572
Live.

793
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:35,443
Lost.

794
01:07:39,612 --> 01:07:41,258
We're lost!

795
01:07:41,939 --> 01:07:45,308
And when Precious goes...

796
01:07:45,346 --> 01:07:48,875
...we'll die, yes.

797
01:07:49,157 --> 01:07:54,008
All of us die into the dust.

798
01:08:02,027 --> 01:08:06,438
How can I kill such a pitiful
and cringing abomination?

799
01:08:06,838 --> 01:08:11,329
I have come to know the strain of bearing
the Ring for even a little while.

800
01:08:11,651 --> 01:08:16,663
But this miserable creature
enslaved to it for years...

801
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,949
Curse you, you stinking thing!

802
01:08:20,431 --> 01:08:23,718
Be off! I don't trust you,
not as far as I could kick you.

803
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:29,051
But be off or I shall hurt you
with nasty cruel steel. Yes!

804
01:08:43,925 --> 01:08:47,776
Now to find Mr. Frodo again.

805
01:08:52,908 --> 01:08:56,556
And here it is. Sammath Naur!

806
01:08:57,437 --> 01:09:02,369
Doorway to the gut of the mountain,
and to hell itself, for all I know.

807
01:09:06,138 --> 01:09:10,949
Dark, hot, reeking.

808
01:09:13,034 --> 01:09:17,644
Frodo! Master!

809
01:09:20,734 --> 01:09:22,739
There's no choice.

810
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:25,064
I have to go in.

811
01:09:39,578 --> 01:09:43,629
And at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields
the tide had turned...

812
01:09:43,748 --> 01:09:47,476
...with the arrival of Theoden
and the armies of Rohan.

813
01:10:04,637 --> 01:10:07,644
-Hail proud Merry!
-Hail Pippin.

814
01:10:08,407 --> 01:10:12,016
Bless you for a sure eye, old friend.
How good to see you!

815
01:10:12,096 --> 01:10:14,540
Bless you for bringing Theoden
and his army.

816
01:10:14,581 --> 01:10:16,185
You've won the day for us!

817
01:10:32,143 --> 01:10:36,473
In the midst of Theoden's glory,
his golden shield was dimmed.

818
01:10:37,114 --> 01:10:41,764
The new morning was blotted
from the sky. And the dark fell upon him.

819
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,824
Fear no darkness, Snowmane.

820
01:10:51,951 --> 01:10:54,195
No, Snowmane!

821
01:11:00,249 --> 01:11:04,818
And the Dark Force had claimed
our savior, Lord of Rohan.

822
01:11:05,742 --> 01:11:08,710
Lord Theoden! Nay.

823
01:11:09,271 --> 01:11:13,318
Oh, my dear master. Oh, the horror.

824
01:11:13,922 --> 01:11:16,849
No, my friend. He is gone!

825
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:19,093
You can do nothing.

826
01:11:20,539 --> 01:11:23,024
Hear me, O Darkness!

827
01:11:23,466 --> 01:11:26,273
I will avenge my lord!

828
01:11:35,573 --> 01:11:36,576
And what event...

829
01:11:37,217 --> 01:11:41,546
...at just that moment
caused evil to enlist such power?

830
01:11:42,268 --> 01:11:44,034
Nothing here, surely.

831
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:48,523
But in the bowels of Mount Doom...

832
01:11:50,528 --> 01:11:55,220
Master! Mr. Frodo.

833
01:11:57,145 --> 01:12:00,071
Master, where are you?

834
01:12:02,758 --> 01:12:05,964
Behold! The Crack of Doom!

835
01:12:06,045 --> 01:12:08,250
-Master.
-Hold. Get back!

836
01:12:08,612 --> 01:12:11,017
Master, it is me, Samwise!

837
01:12:11,859 --> 01:12:14,064
And if that be the Crack of Doom...

838
01:12:14,144 --> 01:12:18,955
...at last do what you've come
all this distance to do!

839
01:12:19,075 --> 01:12:20,039
Now!

840
01:12:20,358 --> 01:12:24,850
I have come. But I do not choose
to do now what I have come to do!

841
01:12:26,535 --> 01:12:31,265
"The bearer of the Ring
The wearer of the Ring

842
01:12:31,866 --> 01:12:36,597
"He hears a voice compelling him

843
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:42,572
"Filling him with thoughts
that echo in his mind

844
01:12:42,813 --> 01:12:47,264
"It should be telling him "

845
01:12:49,227 --> 01:12:53,958
No, Mr. Frodo.
Don't let the Ring claim you!

846
01:12:55,082 --> 01:13:00,094
"Beware the power
is a power never known

847
01:13:00,494 --> 01:13:05,464
"Beware the power
that was simple now has grown

848
01:13:05,987 --> 01:13:10,118
"Beware, oh wearer of the Ring

849
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:15,691
"The final power has yet to be shown"

850
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:21,946
Get back! I am not the Ring's!

851
01:13:21,987 --> 01:13:24,914
The Ring is mine. Look!

852
01:13:32,048 --> 01:13:33,574
Master!

853
01:13:33,894 --> 01:13:35,015
No!

854
01:13:35,858 --> 01:13:37,180
Please!

855
01:13:52,578 --> 01:13:55,787
He had come again, bringing ruin...

856
01:13:55,867 --> 01:13:59,476
...turning hope to despair,
and victory to death.

857
01:14:03,484 --> 01:14:06,852
Be gone, foul Dwimmerlaik,
Lord of Carrion.

858
01:14:06,932 --> 01:14:08,174
Leave the dead in peace!

859
01:14:08,655 --> 01:14:13,268
Come not between the Nazgul
and his prey!

860
01:14:13,468 --> 01:14:16,996
Or he will slay thee in turn.

861
01:14:17,195 --> 01:14:20,083
Do what you will. I will hinder it, if I may!

862
01:14:20,162 --> 01:14:24,535
Hinder me? Thou fool.

863
01:14:24,897 --> 01:14:27,822
Dost thou not know the prophecy?

864
01:14:27,943 --> 01:14:32,351
"No living man may hinder me."

865
01:14:32,512 --> 01:14:34,917
But no living man am I!

866
01:14:34,999 --> 01:14:37,604
You look upon a woman. Eowyn am I.

867
01:14:37,724 --> 01:14:40,491
You stand between me
and my lord and kin.

868
01:14:40,891 --> 01:14:45,783
Be gone for living or dark undead
I will smite you if you touch him!

869
01:14:46,464 --> 01:14:49,190
A woman? Eowyn?

870
01:14:50,996 --> 01:14:53,000
'Tis Lord Theoden's niece!

871
01:14:53,563 --> 01:14:56,369
She wanted to ride with us, but he forbade.

872
01:14:57,091 --> 01:14:59,899
She disguised as a knight
and she came hither!

873
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:07,715
A foul, putrid wind!

874
01:15:08,037 --> 01:15:10,242
How does she bear the stench of it?

875
01:15:10,323 --> 01:15:12,608
Strong she is, and brave.

876
01:15:12,887 --> 01:15:14,731
I must to her aid!

877
01:15:45,164 --> 01:15:45,847
No!

878
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:00,200
It's empty!

879
01:16:00,282 --> 01:16:03,728
Uncle, I have avenged thee!

880
01:16:06,534 --> 01:16:09,541
Theoden was borne
from the field with honor.

881
01:16:09,862 --> 01:16:14,554
And we wondered if, when our own lord,
King Aragorn, returned...

882
01:16:14,594 --> 01:16:16,879
...would his fate be the same?

883
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:25,340
With the death of the Nazgul lord,
Sauron's forces lost heart...

884
01:16:25,701 --> 01:16:28,426
...and began a retreat of abysmal disarray.

885
01:16:31,032 --> 01:16:34,401
And then, as if our triumph
were but a child's toy...

886
01:16:34,843 --> 01:16:38,450
...a game with which Sauron
was playing and taunting us...

887
01:16:38,609 --> 01:16:41,016
...the tide of battle suddenly changed.

888
01:16:41,657 --> 01:16:45,387
For from the wretched forces of evil,
a new cry of hope went up.

889
01:16:49,357 --> 01:16:50,921
The Black Fleet!

890
01:16:51,763 --> 01:16:53,927
That which I dreaded had happened.

891
01:16:54,167 --> 01:16:57,697
For if enemy-laden ships had come
from this direction...

892
01:16:57,817 --> 01:17:02,546
...it meant that the black forces had
already conquered Ethir and Lebennin...

893
01:17:02,828 --> 01:17:05,355
...lands we had thought safely ours.

894
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:14,898
The tide had turned still one more time...

895
01:17:15,337 --> 01:17:17,744
...and this time, against us!

896
01:17:20,432 --> 01:17:21,832
But behold!

897
01:17:22,273 --> 01:17:25,121
As the flagship's standard broke the wind...

898
01:17:25,242 --> 01:17:28,569
...it displayed the sign no lord
had borne for years...

899
01:17:28,809 --> 01:17:31,414
...and which only one lord could bear:

900
01:17:32,578 --> 01:17:36,266
Aragon! He who would be our king...

901
01:17:36,508 --> 01:17:37,671
...had returned!

902
01:17:42,442 --> 01:17:45,609
And the hosts of Mordor
were seized with bewilderment...

903
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:47,372
...and they fled.

904
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,583
That night we held council.

905
01:17:52,588 --> 01:17:55,272
While Aragorn had the enemy on the run...

906
01:17:55,354 --> 01:17:57,758
...he decided to pursue them into Mordor...

907
01:17:58,201 --> 01:18:00,445
...across the Gorgoroth Plateau...

908
01:18:00,645 --> 01:18:05,455
...and to the bastion of Sauron himself,
the Dark Tower of Barad-dur.

909
01:18:06,861 --> 01:18:10,147
The shortest way would be
through the pass at Cirith Ungol.

910
01:18:10,707 --> 01:18:13,554
But that is narrow and dangerous
to move an army through.

911
01:18:13,634 --> 01:18:17,045
And so he decided to march
along the mountains, north...

912
01:18:17,243 --> 01:18:18,728
...and then west...

913
01:18:18,808 --> 01:18:21,775
...to the haunted pass of Cirith Gorgor...

914
01:18:21,855 --> 01:18:24,862
...and the untold legions of the Black Lord.

915
01:18:25,865 --> 01:18:27,669
Why so glum, Wizard?

916
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:32,361
Does the mere thought of Sauron's
vast forces overwhelm your spirit?

917
01:18:32,882 --> 01:18:35,248
This war is without final hope.

918
01:18:35,609 --> 01:18:38,334
Victory cannot be achieved
by force of arms...

919
01:18:38,576 --> 01:18:41,302
...whether you sit here to endure
siege after siege...

920
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:43,587
...or march out to be overwhelmed.

921
01:18:43,868 --> 01:18:45,632
You have only a choice of evils!

922
01:18:45,992 --> 01:18:48,638
Then, if the choice be mine...

923
01:18:49,321 --> 01:18:51,484
...I choose to march!

924
01:18:54,052 --> 01:18:56,537
And for days and nights march we did.

925
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,784
But my spirit was leaden.

926
01:19:06,923 --> 01:19:10,610
"Win the battle, lose the war

927
01:19:10,891 --> 01:19:15,262
"Choice of evils lie before your feet

928
01:19:16,504 --> 01:19:19,392
"Retreat, retreat, retreat"

929
01:19:24,004 --> 01:19:26,367
And finally, the pass.

930
01:19:27,373 --> 01:19:30,018
Guarded by The Towers of the Teeth.

931
01:19:30,541 --> 01:19:34,226
And inside, the Orcs made song
to match my spirit.

932
01:19:34,426 --> 01:19:37,956
"If you win then you will lose

933
01:19:38,317 --> 01:19:41,685
"Choice of evils yours to choose

934
01:19:41,766 --> 01:19:46,737
"Retreat, retreat, retreat

935
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:53,153
"You are standing in the eye of the storm

936
01:19:53,514 --> 01:19:56,960
"Move an inch and you'll be dead

937
01:19:57,481 --> 01:19:59,607
"You are standing underneath

938
01:19:59,688 --> 01:20:04,539
"The Towers of the Teeth

939
01:20:05,739 --> 01:20:09,469
"Win the battle lose the war

940
01:20:09,751 --> 01:20:14,121
"Choice of evils lie before your feet

941
01:20:15,404 --> 01:20:18,412
"Retreat, retreat, retreat"

942
01:20:18,572 --> 01:20:19,815
Silence!

943
01:20:21,698 --> 01:20:23,465
Come forth!

944
01:20:24,145 --> 01:20:26,270
The King of Gondor...

945
01:20:26,351 --> 01:20:29,517
...demands the Black Lord to come forth...

946
01:20:29,638 --> 01:20:33,448
...atone for his evils
and depart them forever!

947
01:20:34,089 --> 01:20:35,451
Come forth!

948
01:20:54,816 --> 01:20:57,584
I am the mouth of Sauron!

949
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:00,431
His emissary, you mean.

950
01:21:00,509 --> 01:21:03,638
For you be no wraith,
but made from flesh and blood...

951
01:21:03,719 --> 01:21:07,930
...beneath that mask
and those robes, even as I!

952
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:13,705
Is there anyone in this rout
with authority to treat with me?

953
01:21:14,105 --> 01:21:16,269
Not thou, Aragorn.

954
01:21:16,309 --> 01:21:20,198
It needs more to make a king
than a rabble such as this.

955
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,364
We shall see!

956
01:21:22,804 --> 01:21:24,127
Be warned.

957
01:21:24,328 --> 01:21:27,776
You are hopelessly outnumbered here.

958
01:21:27,855 --> 01:21:29,541
Our decision is made.

959
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:30,903
Be gone!

960
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:34,951
We did not come here to waste words
in treating with the likes of you...

961
01:21:35,553 --> 01:21:37,559
...one of Sauron's slaves.

962
01:21:37,999 --> 01:21:39,202
Be gone!

963
01:21:39,644 --> 01:21:42,130
We will meet your armies!

964
01:21:47,984 --> 01:21:51,233
"You are standing in the eye of the storm

965

"And the Eye blazes red"

968
01:22:08,151 --> 01:22:10,879
As I faced my own, almost certain death...

969
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:14,047
...I wondered, "Has he the Ring?

970
01:22:14,287 --> 01:22:16,653
"Has Sauron really got the Ring?

971
01:22:16,975 --> 01:22:18,937
"Where is the Ring?"

972
01:22:22,909 --> 01:22:25,794
Had I but known that deep
in the bowels of Mount Doom...

973
01:22:25,836 --> 01:22:30,326
...Samwise had been searching
these many days for his master...

974
01:22:30,605 --> 01:22:35,335
...until he himself had reached the core,
the fiery forge itself.

975
01:22:37,743 --> 01:22:39,747
And this, at last, is it...

976
01:22:40,349 --> 01:22:42,393
...the end of Frodo's quest.

977
01:22:42,512 --> 01:22:46,681
But instead of his triumph,
it ends with his madness.

978
01:22:48,207 --> 01:22:49,609
What's that?

979
01:22:52,497 --> 01:22:53,500
Gollum!

980
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:54,983
Here?

981
01:22:55,343 --> 01:22:57,991
Fighting with something that is not there?

982
01:22:58,632 --> 01:23:00,397
Mr. Frodo!

983
01:23:01,236 --> 01:23:02,840
Invisible!

984
01:23:04,124 --> 01:23:09,097
"Frodo of the nine fingers

985
01:23:10,379 --> 01:23:13,546
"And the Ring of Doom

986
01:23:15,071 --> 01:23:19,440
"Why does he have nine fingers"

987
01:23:38,245 --> 01:23:39,969
Mr. Frodo!

988
01:23:41,091 --> 01:23:46,063
"Where is the Ring of Doom?"

989
01:23:55,487 --> 01:23:58,094
Precious! Precious!

990
01:23:59,496 --> 01:24:02,021
My Precious!

991
01:24:06,755 --> 01:24:09,599
My master! Your poor hand!

992
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,524
My master!

993
01:24:11,565 --> 01:24:12,928
'Tis better this way!

994
01:24:12,968 --> 01:24:15,453
'Tis better than that madness!

995
01:24:16,656 --> 01:24:17,658
Look!

996
01:24:17,861 --> 01:24:18,820
Mine!

997
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,244
Precious!

998
01:24:33,656 --> 01:24:35,982
Gollum has completed our quest.

999
01:24:36,422 --> 01:24:40,633
The Ring is destroyed in the fires
where it was wrought!

1000
01:24:41,317 --> 01:24:42,558
At last...

1001
01:24:42,678 --> 01:24:45,644
...the Ring exists no more!

1002
01:24:49,775 --> 01:24:51,098
She's erupting!

1003
01:24:51,418 --> 01:24:54,627
Quick, master,
back through these cracks, run.

1004
01:25:39,771 --> 01:25:41,538
All Mordor is being destroyed!

1005
01:25:41,938 --> 01:25:43,101
How?

1006
01:25:43,381 --> 01:25:46,309
How? There is but one answer.

1007
01:25:46,829 --> 01:25:49,357
The ring bearer has fulfilled his quest.

1008
01:25:49,798 --> 01:25:51,843
The realm of Sauron is ended!

1009
01:25:52,243 --> 01:25:53,888
And with him, us!

1010
01:25:54,126 --> 01:25:56,933
For the quake cannot tell good from evil.

1011
01:25:57,536 --> 01:25:59,900
Look! See ye!

1012
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:07,279
The Lord of the Eagles and his legions!

1013
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,843
Our armies are saved!

1014
01:26:20,391 --> 01:26:22,873
It's no use! The lava will have us!

1015
01:26:23,677 --> 01:26:27,487
I am glad you are with me
here at the end of all things, Sam.

1016
01:26:27,768 --> 01:26:29,733
And you with me, master.

1017
01:26:31,134 --> 01:26:33,421
I don't want to give up yet.

1018
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:36,827
It's not like me somehow,
if you understand.

1019
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:41,079
Maybe not, Sam.
But it's like things are in the world.

1020
01:26:42,123 --> 01:26:43,284
Hopes fail.

1021
01:26:43,765 --> 01:26:45,169
An end comes.

1022
01:26:45,769 --> 01:26:47,495
There is no escape.

1023
01:27:20,934 --> 01:27:23,178
Die well, Samwise!

1024
01:27:39,097 --> 01:27:40,620
Yes, once again...

1025
01:27:41,021 --> 01:27:43,867
...as he had so many times in the past...

1026
01:27:44,389 --> 01:27:48,998
...Gwaihir, the magnificent Lord of
The Eagles, had come to our rescue.

1027
01:27:49,802 --> 01:27:53,049
The mighty war birds
returned us to Minas-Tirith...

1028
01:27:53,490 --> 01:27:54,934
...where months later...

1029
01:27:55,455 --> 01:27:58,784
...our dead buried, our wounded healed...

1030
01:27:59,184 --> 01:28:02,672
...the fields of Pelennor
green with springtime...

1031
01:28:02,793 --> 01:28:04,956
...the city cleansed and rebuilt...

1032
01:28:05,319 --> 01:28:08,608
...the standard of King Aragorn
was raised finally...

1033
01:28:08,847 --> 01:28:11,053
...to the top of the White Tower.

1034
01:28:11,534 --> 01:28:14,900
And down below,
the restored Great Gate swung open...

1035
01:28:15,902 --> 01:28:20,195
...and King Aragorn officially
took possession of his capital city.

1036
01:28:21,517 --> 01:28:23,801
Behold! The return of the King!

1037
01:28:24,083 --> 01:28:28,695
"The end of the Ring, the return of the King

01:30:33,107 --> 01:30:34,750
But alas, look.

1063
01:30:39,443 --> 01:30:42,208
Just resting my eyes.

1064
01:30:43,012 --> 01:30:46,822
Sweet Bilbo, you will return with us
tomorrow to Hobbitown...

1065
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:50,068
...where you may rest your eyes
as much as you wish.

1066
01:30:50,587 --> 01:30:51,833
Return?

1067
01:30:52,276 --> 01:30:53,476
Nay.

1068
01:30:53,555 --> 01:30:54,880
On the morrow...

1069
01:30:54,959 --> 01:30:58,849
...I depart with Elrond and Gandalf.

1070
01:30:59,369 --> 01:31:00,573
Depart?

1071
01:31:00,694 --> 01:31:02,658
From the Gray Havens.

1072
01:31:03,059 --> 01:31:05,384
On the white ship.

1073
01:31:05,905 --> 01:31:07,509
What means this?

1074
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:10,796
We are old, our job is done.

1075
01:31:12,363 --> 01:31:15,006
The Third Age of Middle-earth is over...

1076
01:31:15,448 --> 01:31:18,298
...and as we pass on to the lands
beyond the sea...

1077
01:31:18,376 --> 01:31:21,862
...the new age of Man begins.

1078
01:31:21,943 --> 01:31:23,509
I shall miss you.

1079
01:31:23,991 --> 01:31:26,594
But I thought only Elves departed thus.

1080
01:31:26,674 --> 01:31:28,520
How can Bilbo join you?

1081
01:31:28,599 --> 01:31:30,523
Bilbo has served us well.

1082
01:31:30,924 --> 01:31:33,409
There is always room for a friend.

1083
01:31:33,809 --> 01:31:36,337
Have I served thee well?

1084
01:31:36,497 --> 01:31:38,463
Need you ask such a question?

1085
01:31:40,869 --> 01:31:43,314
I have grown weary of this world.

1086
01:31:43,513 --> 01:31:46,121
The weight of the Ring all of these years...

1087
01:31:46,322 --> 01:31:48,487
...has worn me far beyond my age.

1088
01:31:49,328 --> 01:31:51,693
I would, if it pleases you...

1089
01:31:51,895 --> 01:31:54,181
...set sail with you on the morrow.

1090
01:31:55,341 --> 01:31:59,152
Good friend,
savior of all we hold precious...

1091
01:31:59,833 --> 01:32:01,996
...of course thou might join us.

1092
01:32:02,518 --> 01:32:03,882
Mr. Frodo.

1093
01:32:04,204 --> 01:32:06,008
We cannot be parted.

1094
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:09,256
But, must I go, too?

1095
01:32:09,897 --> 01:32:11,298
Nay, dear Sam.

1096
01:32:11,462 --> 01:32:13,746
You are still young in spirit.

1097
01:32:13,986 --> 01:32:16,074
You and Merry and Pippin.

1098
01:32:16,793 --> 01:32:19,560
A good life awaits you back in the Shire.

1099
01:32:19,639 --> 01:32:21,686
With plump Hobbit wives...

1100
01:32:21,887 --> 01:32:23,811
...good Hobbit meals...

1101
01:32:23,891 --> 01:32:28,020
...long leisurely smokings
of good Hobbit pipes.

1102
01:32:28,501 --> 01:32:31,426
And laps filled
with bouncing Hobbit babies.

1103
01:32:32,431 --> 01:32:36,200
Now you must keep the book
of the Hobbits up to date.

1104
01:32:38,646 --> 01:32:39,727
I will.

1105
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:43,617
The Orcs and Trolls have gone to dust...

1106
01:32:44,299 --> 01:32:46,786
...the Elves are slowly departing.

1107
01:32:47,467 --> 01:32:50,556
Dwarves have disappeared
into their misty mountains...

1108
01:32:51,595 --> 01:32:54,162
...and there have been no dragons for ages.

1109
01:32:54,764 --> 01:32:55,927
Right!

1110
01:32:57,932 --> 01:32:59,735
What troubles you, Sam?

1111
01:32:59,775 --> 01:33:03,624
Will there be no room for Hobbits
in this new age of Man?

1112
01:33:04,147 --> 01:33:08,436
I think so. For of us all,
Hobbits are the closest to Man...

1113
01:33:08,517 --> 01:33:09,639
...the most human.

1114
01:33:10,079 --> 01:33:12,808
And one day they will be as Men are.

1115
01:33:13,007 --> 01:33:14,249
Look you.

1116
01:33:14,772 --> 01:33:19,423
Frodo is a bit larger than Bilbo,
just as you are larger than Frodo.

1117
01:33:19,862 --> 01:33:23,792
And younger still than you,
and larger are Merry and Pippin.

1118
01:33:25,117 --> 01:33:28,364
And, if you keep the book
of the Hobbits as Frodo asked...

1119
01:33:28,482 --> 01:33:31,690
...ages from now,
when your stories are still told...

1120
01:33:32,173 --> 01:33:37,142
...there will be those humans who might
well wonder, "Is there Hobbit in me?"

1121
01:33:38,708 --> 01:33:39,949
Is there?

1122
01:33:41,315 --> 01:33:44,643
"Roads go ever, ever on

1123
