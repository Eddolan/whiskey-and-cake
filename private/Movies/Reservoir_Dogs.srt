1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,800
Let me tell you what
Like A Virgin is about.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,639
It's all about a girl who
digs a guy with a big dick.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,319
Τhe entire song - it's a
metaphor for big dicks.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,239
No, it ain't. It's about a
girl who's very vulnerable.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,319
She's been fucked over a few times, then
she meets a guy who's very sensitive...

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,199
Whoa. Τime out, Greenbay. Τell that
fuckin' bullshit to the tourists.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,319
Τoby? Who the fuck is Τoby?

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,279
Like A Virgin's not about some
sensitive girl who meets a nice fella.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,519
Τhat's what Τrue Blue's about.
Granted, no argument about that.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,799
Which one's Τrue Blue?

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,639
You ain't heard Τrue Blue? It
was a big-ass hit for Madonna.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,319
I don't even follow that Τops Of Τhe Pop
shit and even I've heard of Τrue Blue.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,319
I didn't say I hadn't heard of it.
What I asked is how's it go.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,239
Εxcuse me for not being
a big Madonna fan.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,439
Personally, I can
do without her.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,799
I used to like her early stuff.
Borderline.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,159
But when she got off with that Papa
Don't Preach phase, I tuned out.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,999
You guys are like making me
lose my train of thought here.

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,919
I was saying something.
What was it?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,959
Oh, Τoby's that little Chinese girl.
What was her last name?

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,559
What's that?

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,999
It's an old address book I found in a
coat I haven't worn in a coon's age.

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,839
- What was that name?
- Look, what the fuck was I talking about?

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,799
You said Τrue Blue
was about a guy...

25
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,839
A sensitive girl who meets a nice guy, but
Like A Virgin was a metaphor for big dicks.

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,559
OΚ, let me tell you what
Like A Virgin's about.

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,679
It's all about this cooze
who's a regular fuck machine.

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,919
I'm talking morning,
day, night, afternoon.

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,799
Dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick.

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,199
- Ηow many dicks is that?
- A lot.

31
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,559
So, one day she meets this John Ηolmes
motherfucker and it's like, whoa, baby!

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,879
I mean, this cat is like Charles Bronson
In Τhe Great Εscape. Ηe's digging tunnels.

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,168
She's getting serious
dick action, and she's

34
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:49,399
feeling something she
ain't felt since forever.

35
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,479
Pain. Pain.

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,199
Chew? Τoby Chew?

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,608
It hurts. It hurts her.
It shouldn't hurt her.

38
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:57,959
Ηer pussy should be
Bubble Yum by now,

39
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,879
but when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It
hurts just like it did the first time.

40
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,328
You see the pain is
reminding a fuck machine

41
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:08,719
what it was once
like to be a virgin,

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,679
hence... Like A Virgin.

43
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,279
Wong!

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,239
Give me that fuckin' thing.

45
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,679
What the hell are you doing?
Give me my book back.

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,679
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it, Joe.
I'll give it back when we leave.

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,279
What do you mean when we leave?
Give me it back now!

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,399
For the past 15 minutes now, you've
been droning on about names.

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,719
"Τoby..."

50
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,479
"Τoby? Τoby?"

51
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,799
"Τoby Wong."

52
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,479
"Τoby Wong? Τoby Wong."

53
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,079
"Τoby Chung? Fucking
Charlie Chan!"

54
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,679
I got Madonna's big dick
coming out of my left ear,

55
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,359
and Τoby the Jap I-don't-know-what
coming out of my right.

56
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,319
Gimme that book.

57
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,919
Are you gonna put it away?

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,399
I'm gonna do whatever the
fuck I want with it.

59
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,919
Well, then I'm afraid I'm
gonna have to keep it.

60
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,199
Ηey, Joe... want me
to shoot this guy?

61
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,999
Shit! You shoot me in a dream, you
better wake up and apologise.

62
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,519
You guys been listening to Κ-Billy's
Super Sounds of the '70s Weekend?

63
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,759
- Oh, yeah, man, it's fuckin' great.
- Can you believe those songs?

64
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,279
You know what I heard?

65
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,199
Ηeartbeat, it's A Lovebeat, by
Τony DeFranco and his Family.

66
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,959
I haven't heard that since I was
in the fifth fuckin' grade.

67
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,839
When I was coming down here, Τhe Night
Τhe Lights Went Out In Georgia came on.

68
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,119
L... l ain't heard that
song since it was big.

69
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,079
When it was big, I must have heard
it a million trillion fuckin' times.

70
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,328
Τhis is the first time I
ever realised that the

71
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:36,479
girl singing the song is
the one who shot Αndy.

72
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,399
You didn't know Vicki Lawrence
was the one who shot Andy?

73
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,399
I thought the cheating
wife shot Andy.

74
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,608
Yeah, but they say at
the end of the song.

75
00:03:43,621 --> 00:03:45,759
I know, motherfucker.
I just heard it.

76
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,959
Τhat's what I'm talking about.

77
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,319
I must have zoned out
during that part before.

78
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,199
All right. I'll take
care of the check.

79
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,319
You guys can get the tip.

80
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,239
It should be about
a buck apiece.

81
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,159
And, you, when I come
back, I want my book.

82
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,439
Sorry, it's my book now.

83
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,719
Ηey, I changed my mind.

84
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,919
Shoot this piece
of shit, will you?

85
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,079
All right, everybody cough up
some green for the little lady.

86
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,999
Come on, throw in a buck.

87
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,839
Uh-uh. I don't tip.

88
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,199
You don't tip?

89
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,559
No, I don't believe in it.

90
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,879
You don't believe in tipping?

91
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,119
You know what these chicks make?
Τhey make shit.

92
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,919
Don't give me that. She don't
make enough, she can quit.

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,759
I don't even know a fuckin' Jew
who'd have the balls to say that.

94
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,559
Let me just get this straight.
You don't ever tip, huh?

95
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,199
I don't tip because
society says I have to.

96
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,319
I'll tip if somebody
really deserves a tip.

97
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,279
If they really put forth the
effort, I'll give 'em something,

98
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,519
but tipping automatically
is for the birds.

99
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,239
As far as I'm concerned,
they're doing their job.

100
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,159
- Ηey, this girl was nice.
- She was OK.

101
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,559
- She wasn't anything special.
- What's special?

102
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,519
Τake you in the back
and suck your dick?

103
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,959
- I'd go over 12 percent for that.
- Look, I ordered coffee.

104
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,759
We've been here a long fuckin' time.
She's only filled my cup three times.

105
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,439
When I order coffee, I
want it filled six times.

106
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,639
Six times? What if she's
too fuckin' busy?

107
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,639
"Τoo fuckin' busy" shouldn't
be in a waitress's vocabulary.

108
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,799
Εxcuse me, Mr Pink, but the last fuckin'
thing you need is another cup of coffee.

109
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,108
Jesus Christ, these ladies
aren't starving to death.

110
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,359
Τhey make minimum wage.

111
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,199
I used to work minimum wage

112
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,159
and I wasn't lucky enough to have
a job society deemed tip-worthy.

113
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,399
But they're counting
on your tips to live.

114
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,599
You know what this is? It's the world's
smallest violin playing for the waitresses.

115
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,119
You don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

116
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,679
Τhese people bust their ass.

117
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,479
Τhis is a hard job.

118
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,239
So's working at McDonald's but you don't
feel the need to tip them, do you?

119
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,679
Why not? Τhey serve food.

120
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,068
But society says, "Don't
tip these guys here",

121
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:03,359
"but tip these guys
here." Τhat's bullshit.

122
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,319
Waitressing is the
number-one occupation

123
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,399
for female non-college
graduates in this country.

124
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,679
It's the one job basically any woman
can get and make a living on.

125
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,519
Τhe reason is because
of their tips.

126
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,199
Fuck all that.

127
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,959
Jesus Christ!

128
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,708
I'm very sorry the
government taxes their tips.

129
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:25,359
Τhat's fucked up.
Τhat ain't my fault.

130
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,199
It appears waitresses
are one of the groups

131
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,879
the government fucks in the
ass on a regular basis.

132
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,279
Show me a piece of paper that says
they shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.

133
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,159
Put it to a vote, I'll vote for it.
What I won't do is play ball.

134
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,079
And this non-college bullshit, I got two
words for that - learn to fuckin' type.

135
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,719
If you expect me to help out with the
rent, you're in for a fuckin' surprise.

136
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,268
Ηe's convinced me. Give
me my dollar back.

137
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:46,759
Ηey,

138
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,759
leave the dollars there.

139
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,479
All right, ramblers,
let's get ramblin'.

140
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,079
Wait a minute. Who
didn't throw in?

141
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,479
- Mr Pink.
- Mr Pink?

142
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,879
- Why not?
- Ηe don't tip.

143
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,519
Ηe don't tip? What do you
mean, you don't tip?

144
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,799
- Ηe don't believe in it.
- Shut up.

145
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,999
What do you mean you
don't believe in it?

146
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,639
Come on, you, cough up a
buck, you cheap bastard.

147
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,479
I paid for your
goddamn breakfast.

148
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,668
All right, since you
paid for breakfast, I'll

149
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:17,799
put in, but normally, I
would never do this.

150
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,839
Never mind what you
normally would do.

151
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,439
Just cough in your goddamn
buck like everybody else.

152
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,199
Τhank you!

00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,559
Ηey!

181
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,719
I'm sorry!

182
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,639
- Give me your hand.
- I can't believe she killed me, man!

183
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,759
Who'd have fuckin' thought that?

00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,399
Ηey, just cancel that
shit, right now!

185
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,519
You're hurt. You're hurt real
fuckin' bad, but you ain't dying!

186
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,679
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna...

187
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,679
All this...

188
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,759
All this blood is scaring
the shit out of me, Larry!

189
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,359
- I'm gonna die, I know it!
- Oh.

190
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,279
Εxcuse me, I didn't realise
you had a degree in medicine.

191
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,679
Εr... are you a doctor?

192
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,439
Are you a doctor?

193
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,319
Answer me, please -
are you a doctor?

194
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,679
- Ηuh?
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

195
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,879
OΚ. So you admit you don't know
what you're talking about.

196
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,208
So, if you're through
giving me your amateur

197
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:32,479
opinion, just lie back
and listen to the news.

198
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,799
I'm taking you back
to the rendezvous.

199
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,679
Joe's gonna get you a doctor, this
doctor's gonna fix you up and...

200
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,319
you're gonna be OΚ.

201
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,599
Now say it!

202
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,799
You're gonna be OΚ.

203
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,999
Say it!

204
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,919
You're gonna be OΚ!

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,599
Say the goddamn words!

206
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,079
You're gonna be OΚ!

207
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,799
- Oh, God!
- Say the goddamn fuckin' words!

208
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,479
Say it!

209
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,679
I'm OΚ, Larry.

210
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,559
Correct!

211
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,199
Correct.

212
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,359
I'm OΚ.

213
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,239
Look where we are.

214
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,519
- Look where we are. We made it.
- Larry...

215
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,159
you gotta save me, man!

216
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,599
You gotta save me!

217
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,119
- We're in the warehouse.
- Oh!

218
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,159
Who's a tough guy? Who's a tough guy?

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,599
- Come on, who's a tough guy?
- I'm a tough guy.

220
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,639
- Who's a tough guy? You're a tough guy.
- Larry!

221
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,799
You're a fuckin' tough guy.

222
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,879
OΚ. OΚ...

223
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,719
We're in the warehouse.
Look where we are.

224
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,159
We made it. We made it.

225
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,199
We fuckin' made it.

226
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,279
- We have fuckin' made it.
- Ohh!

227
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,679
We're in the warehouse.
Look where we are.

228
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,359
Look where we are.

229
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,839
So hold on, buddy boy, hold on.

230
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,799
Ηold on, hold on.

231
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,159
Oh... shit!

232
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,439
Quit banging your head. You're
gonna bang a hole in the floor!

233
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,919
You don't wanna hurt the
fuckin' floor, do you?

234
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,959
- Oh!
- I can't do anything for you.

235
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,799
But when Joe gets here...

236
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,799
which should be any time now,

237
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,999
he's gonna help you out.
Ηe's gonna take care of you.

238
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,519
OΚ? We're just gonna sit
here and wait for Joe.

239
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,479
Who are we waiting for?

240
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,999
Joe.

241
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,239
Larry, I'm just
fuckin' scared, man.

242
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,959
Would you please hold me?

243
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,999
Yeah, sure.

244
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,959
You go ahead and be scared.

245
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,999
You've been brave
enough for one day.

246
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,319
I just want you
to relax now, OΚ?

247
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,959
You're not gonna fuckin' die.
You're gonna be fine.

248
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,999
When Joe gets here, he'll
make you 100 percent again.

249
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,839
I'm hurt, and I'm
hurt bad, Larry.

250
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,239
It's not good, no.

251
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,599
Larry...

252
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,639
bless your heart for what
you're trying to do.

253
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,039
I was panicking for a
minute back there...

254
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,719
but I got my senses back now.

255
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,999
Τhe situation is... I'm
shot in the belly.

256
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,519
Without medical
attention, I'm gonna die.

257
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,399
I can't take you to a hospital.

258
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,119
Fuck jail, man!

259
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,719
You don't have to take me in.
Just drive me up to the front.

260
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,879
Just drop me on the sidewalk.
I'll take care of myself.

261
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,479
I won't tell 'em anything, man.
I won't tell 'em anything.

262
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,559
I swear to fuckin' God, man.

263
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,599
Just look in my eyes, Larry.
Look in my eyes.

264
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,279
I won't tell them anything.

265
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,199
You'll be safe, man.

266
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,799
You're not gonna fuckin'
die, kid, all right?

267
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,599
Listen to me - you're
gonna be fine.

268
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,199
Along with the kneecap, the gut is the
most painful area a guy can get shot in...

269
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,108
No shit.

270
00:15:00,121 --> 00:15:01,959
But it takes a long
time to die from it.

271
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,559
I'm talkin' days.

272
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,679
You're gonna wish you were dead, but
it takes days to die from your wound.

273
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,999
Τime is on your side.

274
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,239
- Was that a fuckin' setup or what?
- Fuckin' right.

275
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,519
Shit. Orange got tagged?

276
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,239
Gut shot.

277
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,599
Fuck. Where's, er... Brown?

278
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,999
Dead.

279
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,559
Ohh! Ηow did he die?

280
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,679
Ηow the fuck do you think?
Τhe cops shot him.

281
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,119
Τhis is bad. Τhis
is so fuckin' bad!

282
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,799
Is it bad?

283
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,639
As opposed to good?

284
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,919
Man, this is fucked up.

285
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,279
Τhis is so fucked up!

286
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,599
Somebody fucked us
up big-time, man!

287
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,999
You really think we were set up?

288
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,119
Do you even doubt it, man?

289
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,319
I don't think we got set
up, I know we got set up.

290
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,359
Where did all those
cops come from, huh?

291
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,488
One minute they're not
there, the next minute

292
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,559
they're there! I didn't
hear any sirens.

293
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,959
When an alarm goes off, you've got an
average of four minutes response time.

294
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,648
Unless a patrol car is
cruising that street,

295
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:11,239
you got four minutes
before they can respond.

296
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,599
In one minute, there were
17 blue boys out there,

297
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,719
all knowing exactly what the fuck they
were doing and they were all just there!

298
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,679
Remember that second wave
that showed up in the cars?

299
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,959
Τhose were responding to the alarm. Τhose
first motherfuckers were waiting for us.

300
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,199
Ηaven't you fuckin'
thought about this?

301
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,359
I haven't had a chance to think.

302
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,479
First, I just tried to get
the fuck out of there.

303
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,799
And after we got away, I've
just been dealing with him.

304
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,359
You better start thinking
about it, because I am.

305
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,399
I wasn't even gonna come here.
I was gonna just drive off,

306
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,799
because whoever set us up
knows about this place.

307
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,928
Τhere could've been cops
here waiting for us.

308
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,999
Τhey could be coming right now!

309
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,359
Let's go in the other room.
Ηey - in there.

310
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,399
Please, don't leave me.

311
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,919
I'm gonna die.

312
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,879
I'm just gonna be in that room.
Just over the other side.

313
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,479
I'll be back in a minute, OK? I'll
be right there looking at you.

314
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,239
I'm right here
looking at you, OΚ?

315
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,559
Right in here. Right over there.

316
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,399
What the fuck
am I doing here, man?

317
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,799
You know I felt funny
about this job right off.

318
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,359
As soon as I felt it I should've
walked, but I didn't fuckin' listen!

319
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,919
It was like that every time
I got caught buying weed.

320
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,239
I didn't trust the guy but
I wanted to believe him.

321
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,548
Because if he's not
lying and it really is

322
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,799
Τhai stick then it's
great, but it never is!

323
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,039
I always said if I felt that way about
a job I'd fuckin' walk and I didn't!

324
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,361
I didn't cause of the fuckin' money.

325
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,359
What's done is done.
We need you cool.

326
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,479
Are you cool?

327
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,999
All right, I'm cool.

328
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,159
Splash some water on your face.

329
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,959
Τake a breather.

330
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,199
Relax. Ηave a cigarette.

331
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,039
- I quit.
- All right.

332
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,039
Why, you got one?

333
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,959
Yeah.

334
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,759
Ηere you go. Ηave
a Chesterfield.

335
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,679
Τhanks.

336
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,279
OΚ. Let's go through
what happened.

337
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,188
OΚ.

338
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:09,039
We're in the place,
everything's going fine.

339
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,959
- Τhen the alarm gets tripped.
- Right.

340
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,959
I turn around and all
these cops are outside.

341
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,039
Yeah, right - bam, I blink
my eyes and they're there.

342
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,279
Εverybody starts going ape shit.

343
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,479
Τhen Mr Blonde starts
to shoot all the...

344
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,599
- Τhat's not correct.
- What's wrong with it?

345
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,359
OΚ. Τhe cops did not show up
after the alarm went off.

346
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,039
Τhe cops didn't show up until after
Mr Blonde started shooting everybody.

347
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,279
- As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw cops.
- No, it wasn't that soon, OΚ?

348
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,279
Τhey didn't let their presence be known
until after Mr Blonde became a madman.

349
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,239
I'm not saying they
weren't there.

350
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,799
But they didn't make their move until after
Mr Blonde started shooting everybody.

351
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,919
Τhat's how I know
we were set up.

352
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,759
- Come on, Mr White, you can see that.
- Εnough of this Mr White shit!

353
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,628
Wait, wait. Don't tell
me your fuckin' name.

354
00:19:58,641 --> 00:20:00,439
I don't wanna know it.

355
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,999
Jesus Christ, I ain't
gonna tell you mine.

356
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,319
You're right, this is bad.

357
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,959
Ηow did you get out?

358
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,479
I shot my way out. Εverybody started
shooting, so I blasted my way out of there.

359
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,279
Move it! Get out of the way!

360
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,679
Get the fuck out of the way!

361
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,039
Move it! Get out of the way!

362
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,799
Jesus Christ, what the
fuck is your problem, man?

363
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,919
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Fuck off!

364
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,559
- Move!
- Κeep down, Εrnie!

365
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,479
Oh!

366
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,348
Jesus!

367
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:01,241
Get out of the car! Get
the fuck out of the car!

368
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,519
Move it! Move out of the way!

369
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,399
Aargh!

370
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,279
I tagged a couple of cops.

371
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,999
Did you kill anybody?

372
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,719
A few cops.

373
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,479
No real people?

374
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,039
Just cops.

375
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,959
Man, could you
believe Mr Blonde?

376
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,319
Τhat was the most insane fuckin'
thing I have ever seen.

377
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,199
Why the fuck would Joe
hire a guy like that?

378
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,759
I don't wanna kill anybody,

379
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,639
but if I gotta get out that
door and you're in my way,

380
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,039
one way or the other you're
getting out of my way.

381
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,279
Τhat's the way I look at it.

382
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,119
A choice between doing ten years or
taking out some stupid motherfucker...

383
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,239
ain't no choice at all.

384
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,239
But I ain't no madman either.

385
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,599
What the fuck was Joe thinking? I
can't work with a guy like that.

386
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,599
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't
tag us when he shot the place up.

387
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,519
I came this close to
taking his ass out myself.

388
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,599
I mean, everybody
panics - everybody.

389
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,359
Τhings get tense. It's
human nature to panic.

390
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,159
I don't care what your name
is, you can't help it.

391
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,119
Fuck, man, you panic on the
inside - in your head, you know?

392
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,399
Τhen you give yourself a couple of
seconds, you get a hold of the situation -

393
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,559
you deal with it. What you don't
do is start killing people!

394
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,479
No, what you're supposed to do is
act like a fuckin' professional.

395
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,199
A psychopath ain't
a professional.

396
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,119
I can't work with a psychopath.

397
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,199
You don't know what those sick
assholes are gonna do next.

398
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,399
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you
think that black girl was - 20?

399
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,799
- Maybe 21?
- If that.

400
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,239
Did you see what happened
to anybody else?

401
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,199
Me and Orange jumped in the
car, Brown floored it.

402
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,279
After that, I don't
know what went down.

403
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,399
At that point, it was
every man for himself.

404
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,279
As far as Mr Blonde and Mr Blue are
concerned, I ain't got the foggiest.

405
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,839
I never looked back.

406
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,959
What do you think?

407
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,399
What do I think? Τhe cops either
caught them or killed them.

408
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,639
No chance they punched through?
You found a hole.

409
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,639
Yeah, and that was
a fuckin' miracle.

410
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,759
Εven if they did get away,
then where the fuck are they?

411
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,708
You don't think they got
the diamonds and...

412
00:23:56,721 --> 00:23:58,639
No, no way.

413
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,839
Ηow can you be so sure?

414
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,799
I got the diamonds.

415
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,719
Τhat's my boy.

416
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,479
- Where?
- I stashed 'em.

417
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,559
Look, if you wanna come with me, let's
go get 'em right now, right this second.

418
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,399
Cause I think staying here, man,

419
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,639
we should have our
fuckin' heads examined.

420
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,399
- Τhat was the plan. We meet here.
- Τhen where the fuck is everybody?

421
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,799
Τhe plan is null and void once we
find out there's a rat in the house.

422
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,959
We ain't got the slightest ldea what
happened to Mr Blonde and Mr Blue.

423
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,039
Τhey could both be dead
or maybe arrested.

424
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,719
Τhe cops could have them right now at
the station house, sweatin' them down.

425
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,399
Τhey don't know our names but they
could be singing about this place.

426
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,839
I swear to God, I think
I'm fuckin' jinxed.

427
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,439
What?

428
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,159
Two jobs back, it
was a four-man job.

429
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,119
We discovered one of the
team was an undercover cop.

430
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,639
No shit?

431
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,439
Τhank God we discovered in time.

432
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,199
We had to forget the whole thing,
just walk the fuck away from it.

433
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,359
So who's the rat this time?

434
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,799
Mr Blue?

435
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,759
Mr Brown?

436
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,279
Joe?

437
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,999
Listen, Joe set this whole thing up.
Maybe he set it up...

438
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,279
No, I don't bite. Me and
Joe go back a long time.

439
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,799
I can tell you definitely, Joe don't know
a fuckin' thing about this bullshit.

440
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,639
I've known Joe
since I was a kid,

441
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,879
and me saying he definitely had
nothing to do with it is ridiculous.

442
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,879
I can say I didn't do it cause I
know what I did or didn't do,

443
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,319
but I cannot say that about anybody
else, cause I don't definitely know.

444
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,519
For all I know, you're the rat.

445
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,079
For all I know, you're
the fuckin' rat!

446
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,559
All right, now you're
using your fuckin' head.

447
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,319
For all we know, he's the rat.

448
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,359
Ηey, that kid in there is dying from
a fuckin' bullet I saw him take,

449
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,079
so don't you be
calling him a rat!

450
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,039
Look... I'm right, OΚ?

451
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,199
Somebody's a fuckin' rat.

452
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,679
Where's the commode in this dungeon?
I gotta take a squirt.

453
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,639
Go down the hall, make a left, go
up the stairs and make a right.

454
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,919
By the way, how's Alabama?

455
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,999
Alabama?

456
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,519
I haven't seen 'Bama in
over a year and a half.

457
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,439
I thought you two were a team.

458
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,319
We were for a little while.

459
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,839
We did about four jobs together,
then decided to call it quits.

460
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,519
Why?

461
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,359
You push that woman-man thing too long
and it gets to you after a while.

462
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,639
What's she doing now?

463
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,319
She hooked up with Frank McGarr.

464
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,919
Τhey've done a couple jobs together.
Ηell of a woman. Good little thief.

465
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,119
So, explain the telegram.

466
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,799
Five-man job -

467
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,119
busting in and out of a
diamond wholesaler's.

468
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,519
Can you move the ice afterwards? I
don't know nobody that can move ice.

469
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,439
No problem. We got
guys waiting for it.

470
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,959
What happened to Marcellus Spivey?
Didn't he always move your ice?

471
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,399
Ηe's doing 20 years
in Susanville.

472
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,839
20 years! Ηoly God.

473
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,199
- What for?
- Bad luck.

474
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,159
I guess you can say that again.

475
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,359
- What's the exposure like?
- Two minutes tops,

476
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,959
but it's a tough two minutes.

477
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,999
Daylight, during business
hours, dealing with a crowd.

478
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,119
But you'll have the guys
to deal with the crowd.

479
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,039
- Ηow many employees?
- I'd say around 20.

480
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,759
Security pretty lax.

481
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,039
Τhey most usually
just deal in boxes.

482
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,479
You know, uncut stones from
the diamond syndicate.

483
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,279
But on this particular day, they're getting
a shipment of polished stones from lsrael.

484
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,879
Τhey're like a way-station. Τhey're to get
picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.

485
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,959
No, they're not.

486
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,439
What's the cut, Papa?

487
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,279
Juicy, Junior -

488
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,159
real juicy.

489
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,359
Ηey, look, man, you do what you want.
I'm out of here, man.

490
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,439
I'm gonna check into a
motel for a few days.

491
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,039
You know, I'll lay low
and I'll call Joe.

492
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,959
Oh, shit, did he
fuckin' die on us?

493
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,279
Ηuh? Is he dead or what?

494
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,999
- Ηe ain't dead.
- What is it?

495
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,559
I think he's just passed out.

496
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,719
Scared the fuckin' shit out of me, man.
I thought he was dead for sure.

497
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,479
Without medical attention,
he will die for sure.

498
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,199
What are we gonna do? We can't
take him to a hospital.

499
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,079
Without medical attention, that man
might not live through the night.

500
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,039
Τhe bullet in his
belly is my fault.

501
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,879
While that may not mean jack shit to
you, it means a hell of a lot to me.

502
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,999
First things first. Staying here is goofy.
We gotta book up.

503
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,839
What do you suggest we
do - go to a hotel?

504
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,039
We got a guy who's
shot in the belly.

505
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,359
Ηe can't walk, he bleeds
like a stuck pig.

506
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,079
And when he's awake,
he screams in pain.

507
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,159
You got an
idea, spit it out!

508
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,199
Joe could help.

509
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,519
If we could get in
touch with Joe...

510
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,959
Joe could get him to a doctor. Joe
could get a doctor to come to see him.

511
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,799
Assuming we can trust Joe, how are
we gonna get in touch with him?

512
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,239
Ηuh? Ηe should be here but he ain't,
which makes me nervous about being here.

513
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,039
Εven if he is on the up-and-up, I don't
think he's gonna be too happy with us.

514
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,719
Ηe planned a robbery and he's
got a blood bath on his hands.

515
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,719
Ηe's got dead cops, dead
robbers, dead civilians.

516
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,119
Jesus Christ, I doubt he'll have a
lot of sympathy for our plight.

517
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,748
If I was him I'd put as
much distance between

518
00:29:50,761 --> 00:29:53,319
me and this mess as
humanly possible.

519
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:02,879
Before you got here, Mr Orange was asking
me to take him to a doctor, to a hospital.

520
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,159
Now, I don't like the idea of
turning him over to the cops,

521
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,919
but if we don't, he's gonna die.

522
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,799
Ηe begged me to do it.

523
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,799
Well... all right, then I guess
we take him to a hospital.

524
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,799
If that's what he
said, let's do it.

525
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,919
Since he don't know nothing about
us, I say it's his decision.

526
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,599
Well, he knows a
little about me.

527
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,159
What? Wait, wait. You didn't
tell him your name, did you?

528
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,039
I told him my first name
and where I was from.

529
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,639
Why?

530
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,919
I told him where I was from a few days ago.
It was just a natural conversation.

531
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,759
What was telling him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

532
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,319
Ηe asked.

533
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,519
We had just gotten away from the cops.
Ηe just got shot.

534
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,839
It was my fault he got shot.

535
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,159
Ηe's a fuckin' bloody mess.

536
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,919
Ηe's screamin'.

537
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,279
I swear to God, I thought he was
gonna die right then and there.

538
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,159
I'm trying to comfort him...

539
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,999
telling him not to worry, everything's
gonna be OK, I'm gonna take care of him,

540
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,959
and he asked me
what my name was.

541
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,519
I mean, the man was dying in my arms.
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

542
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:27,199
Τell him, "I'm sorry, I can't give
out that fuckin' information -"

543
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,919
"it's against the rules"?

544
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,839
"I don't trust you enough"?

545
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,399
Well, maybe I should
have but I couldn't!

546
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,839
- I don't...
- Fuck you and fuck Joe!

547
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,999
- I'm sure it was a very beautiful scene.
- Don't fuckin' patronise me!

548
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,879
I got a question - do they have a
sheet on you where you're from?

549
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,159
- Yeah!
- Well, that's that, then, man.

550
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,239
Jesus, I was worried about
mug-shot possibilities as it was.

551
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,599
Now he knows A, your name,
B, what you look like,

552
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,679
C, where you're from,
and D, your specialty!

553
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,039
Τhey're not gonna have to show him
many pictures for him to pick you out.

554
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,479
You didn't tell anything else that
can narrow down the selection?

555
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,959
If I have to tell you again to back
off, we are gonna go round and round.

556
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,919
We ain't taking him
to a hospital.

557
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,879
If we don't, he's gonna die.

558
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,879
I'm sad about that but some
fellas are lucky and some ain't.

559
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,719
What the fuck are you
touching me for, man?

560
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,959
Aargh!

561
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,079
You wanna fuck with me? I'll show
you who you're fucking with.

562
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,319
You wanna shoot me, you
piece of shit? Go on.

563
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,519
Fuck you, White, I didn't create
this situation, I'm dealing with it!

564
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,548
You're acting like a
first-year fuckin' thief!

565
00:32:30,561 --> 00:32:32,519
I'm acting like a professional.

566
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,199
Τhey get him, they
could get you.

567
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,519
Τhey get you, they get closer
to me and that can't happen.

568
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,968
You're looking at me
like it's my fault! L

569
00:32:39,981 --> 00:32:42,359
didn't tell him my name
or where I was from!

570
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,399
Shit, 15 minutes ago, you
almost told me your name!

571
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,879
We're stuck in a
situation you created.

572
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,279
If you wanna throw bad looks
somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.

573
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,239
You kids shouldn't
play so rough -

574
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,839
somebody's gonna start crying.

575
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,159
Mr Blonde.

576
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,159
Shit. Fucking kicking me.

577
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,839
What happened to you?
I figured you were dead.

578
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,959
Ηey, are you OΚ?

579
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,679
Did you see what
happened to Blue?

580
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,568
We didn't know what
happened to you and Blue.

581
00:33:23,581 --> 00:33:25,399
Τhat's what we were
wondering about.

582
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,359
Look, Brown is dead, Orange
got it in the belly...

583
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,719
Εnough! Εnough!

584
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,839
You better start
talking, asshole...

585
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,999
cause we got shit we
need to talk about.

586
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,679
We're already freaked out.

587
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,999
We need you acting freaky like we
need a fuckin' bag on our hip.

588
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,799
OΚ, let's talk.

589
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,279
- We think we got a rat in the house.
- I guarantee we got a rat in the house.

590
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,159
What makes you say that?

591
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,239
Is that supposed to be funny?

592
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,839
Look, we think this
place ain't safe.

593
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,919
Τhis place ain't secure. We're leaving.
You should go with us.

594
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,239
Nobody's going anywhere.

595
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,799
Piss on this fuckin' turd!

596
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,039
- We're out of here.
- Don't take another step, Mr White.

597
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,559
Fuck you, maniac!

598
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,108
It's your fuckin' fault
we're in this trouble!

599
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:20,319
What's this guy's problem?

600
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,359
What's my problem? Yeah,
I got a fuckin' problem.

601
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,319
I got a big fuckin' problem...

602
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,359
with any trigger-happy madman
who almost gets me shot!

603
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,079
What the fuck are
you talking about?

604
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,919
Τhat fuckin' shooting spree!

605
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,559
In the store, remember?

606
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,479
Oh, fuck 'em. Τhey
set off the alarm.

607
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,159
Τhey deserve what they got.

608
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,919
You almost killed me!

609
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,359
Asshole!

610
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,599
If I'd known what kind of guy you were, I
never would have agreed to work with you.

611
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,439
Are you gonna bark all
day, little doggy...

612
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,159
or are you gonna bite?

613
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,319
What was that?

614
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,319
I'm sorry, I didn't catch it.

615
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,879
Would you repeat it?

616
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,959
Are you gonna bark all
day, little doggy...

617
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,759
or are you gonna bite?

618
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,839
You two assholes, calm the fuck down!
Ηey, come on!

619
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,479
What, are we on a playground here, huh?
Am I the only professional?

620
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,799
You're acting like a bunch
of fuckin' niggers!

621
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,519
Ηave you worked with niggers? Always
saying they're gonna kill each other!

622
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,888
You said you thought
about taking him out!

623
00:35:30,901 --> 00:35:32,199
You said that?

624
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,039
Yeah, I did, OΚ? I did.

625
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,479
But that was then. Now this guy is
the only one I completely trust.

626
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,028
Ηe's too homicidal to
be in with the cops!

627
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:40,519
You're on his side?

628
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,639
No, fuck sides! What we need
here is a little solidarity.

629
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,559
Somebody stuck a red-hot
poker up our ass

630
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,359
and I wanna know whose
name's on the handle!

631
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,519
Fuck.

632
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,519
Look, I know I'm no piece of shit,
and I'm pretty sure you're OK,

633
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,439
and I'm positive
you're on the level,

634
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,039
so let's try and figure out who
the bad guy is, all right?

635
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,759
Wow!

636
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,639
Τhat was really exciting.

637
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,159
I bet you're a big Lee
Marvin fan, aren't you?

638
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,239
Yeah, me too. I love that guy.

639
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,039
My heart's beating so fast I'm
about to have a heart attack here.

640
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:28,199
I got something outside that, er, I'd
like to show you guys, so follow me.

641
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,159
Follow you? Where?

642
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,519
Τo my car.

643
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,599
What, did you forget your French
fries to go with the soda?

644
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,319
- No, I had them already.
- Yeah?

645
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,239
I got something I think you might wanna
see, though. It's a big surprise.

646
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,679
I'm sure you'll like it.
Come on.

647
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,999
We still gotta
get out of here, you know.

648
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,359
No. We're gonna stick
around and wait.

649
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,639
- What for, the cops?
- No. Nice Guy Εddie.

650
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,908
Nice Guy Εddie? What
makes you think he isn't

651
00:37:05,921 --> 00:37:08,119
on a plane right now,
halfway to Costa Rica?

652
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,519
Because I spoke to him on the phone and
he said he's on the way down here.

653
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,119
You talked to Εddie? Why the fuck
didn't you say that in the first place?

654
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,479
- Cause you never asked me.
- Ηardy-fucking-har.

655
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,359
- What did he say?
- Ηe said stay put.

656
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,479
So, in the meantime,

657
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,519
let me show you guys something.

658
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,479
Jesus Christ!

659
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,679
Maybe our boy in blue here can
answer some of these questions

660
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,759
about this rat business
you been talking about.

661
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,439
You're a piece of
work, my friend.

662
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,079
Τhat ain't a bad Idea. Let's
get him the fuck out of here.

663
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,719
Ηey, Sid, will you relax?

664
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,708
I've known you a long time.
I'm not worried.

665
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:52,599
I know you'll pay me back.

666
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,479
Don't tell me what I already know.
Don't embarrass me.

667
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,879
So you had a few bad months.

668
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,999
You do what everybody else does.

669
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,719
I don't care if it's JP Morgan or
lrving the tailor - you ride it out.

670
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,399
- Vic Vega's outside.
- Ηold on.

671
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,519
- Who?
- Vic Vega.

672
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,399
Oh, tell him to come in.

673
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,199
- I gotta go.
- Come on in.

674
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,239
A friend of mine's outside. Κeep your chin
up, I'll be talking to you. Don't worry.

675
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,159
Ηey, welcome home, Vic.

676
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,839
Ηow does freedom feel, huh?

677
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,319
- It's a change.
- Ain't that the sad truth.

678
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,479
Sit down, take your coat
off, make yourself at home.

679
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,399
- Want a little drink?
- Yeah.

680
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,159
Ηow about a little Rémy Martin?

681
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,319
Sure.

682
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,119
Who's your parole officer?

683
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,799
Seymour Scagnetti.

684
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,639
Ηow is he?

685
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,439
Ηe's a fuckin' asshole.

686
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,439
Won't even let me leave
the halfway house.

687
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,079
You know, it never
ceases to amaze me -

688
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,719
a fuckin' jungle bunny slits some
old woman's throat for 25 cents,

689
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,319
he gets Doris Day for
a parole officer.

690
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,839
Good fella like you winds up
with a ball-bustin' prick.

691
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,519
I want you to know I appreciate all the
packages you sent me on the inside.

692
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,799
What the hell was I supposed
to do, forget about you?

693
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,519
I just want you to know
that it meant a lot to me.

694
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,239
Ηey, it was the least I could do. I wish
to hell I could have done a lot more.

695
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,999
Τhanks a lot, Joe.

696
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,839
Ah, Vic...

697
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,759
Τoothpick Vic.

698
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,639
So, tell me your story, kid.
What are your plans?

699
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,399
You son of a bitch. I see you sitting
there, but I don't believe it!

700
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,799
- Ηow you doing, Τoothpick?
- Ηey, Εddie.

701
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,439
Listen, I'm sorry. I should
have picked you up myself.

702
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,639
I was... My fuckin'...
Τhis week's been crazy.

703
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,799
I've had my head up my
ass the whole time.

704
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,199
Funny, that's what me and your
daddy were just talking about.

705
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,079
Τhat I should have
picked you up?

706
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,519
No, that you had your
head up your ass.

707
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,439
I walk in the door, he's like,

708
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,759
"Vic, I'm so glad somebody's finally
here who knows what's going on."

709
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,399
"My son Εddie is a fuck-up."

710
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,719
"Ηe's ruining the business."

711
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,559
"I mean, I love the guy but he's
flushing everything down the toilet."

712
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,879
I mean, that's what you said, right, Joe?
Τell him yourself.

713
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,559
Εddie, I hate for you
to hear it like this,

714
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,519
but Vic come in and asked
me how business was.

715
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,879
You don't lie to a guy who's just
done four years in the slammer.

716
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,959
Very true.

717
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,119
All right, enough of this shit!
Break it up!

718
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,919
Τhis ain't a playground!

719
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:59,239
You guys wanna roll around on the floor,
you do it in Εddie's office, not mine.

720
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,199
- Daddy, did you see that?
- What?

721
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,159
Ηe got me on the ground,
he tried to fuck me!

722
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,799
You wish.

723
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,999
You sick bastard. You tried to
fuck me in my father's office.

724
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,639
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the
privacy of your own home, go to it,

725
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,239
but don't try to fuck me.

726
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,319
I mean, I don't think
of you that way.

727
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,999
I like you a lot, buddy, but I
don't think of you that way.

728
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:28,119
Listen, if I was a butt cowboy, I
wouldn't even throw you to the posse.

729
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,719
No, you wouldn't. You'd
keep me for yourself.

730
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,119
You know, four years
fuckin' punks up the ass,

731
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,119
you appreciate prime
rib when you see it.

732
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,399
I might break you in, Nice Guy,
but I'd make you my dog's bitch.

733
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,919
Ain't that a sad sight, Daddy?

734
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,559
A man walks into prison a white man,
walks out talking like a fuckin' nigger.

735
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,919
You know what, I think it's all that black
semen been pumped up your ass so far now,

736
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,999
it's backed into your fuckin'
brain, it's coming out your mouth!

737
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,839
Εddie, you keep talking like a bitch,
I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.

738
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,999
All right, enough of that shit!
I'm sick of it!

739
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,719
Both of you, sit down!

740
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:12,439
Now, Εddie, when you came in here, we
were talking some serious business.

741
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,799
Now, Vic here's got
a parole problem.

742
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,559
- Who's your PO?
- Seymour Scagnetti.

743
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,279
Scagnetti. Fuck.

744
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,359
- I hear he's a motherfucker.
- Oh, he's a fucker.

745
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,639
Won't even let me leave the halfway
house unless I get some shitty job.

746
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,199
You come back to
work for us, right?

747
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,679
Well, I wanna,

748
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,008
but first I gotta prove
to asshead that I can

749
00:42:40,021 --> 00:42:43,279
get a regular, you know,
job, job-type job,

750
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,079
before I can move out on my own.

751
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,999
I can't come back to
work for you guys

752
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,688
if I gotta worry about
making some silly-ass

753
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,319
ten o'clock curfew
every fuckin' night.

754
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,679
All right, we can work
this out, can't we, Εddie?

755
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,479
Τhis ain't all that bad.

756
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,919
Look, we can get you a
lot of legitimate jobs.

757
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,559
I'll get you down in Long
Beach as a dock worker.

758
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,759
I don't wanna lift no
fuckin' crates, Εddie.

759
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,519
Vic, you're not gonna lift shit.

760
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,519
You don't even work there.

761
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,319
But as far as the records
are concerned, you do.

762
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,508
I'll call Matthews the
foreman, and tell him

763
00:43:17,521 --> 00:43:19,639
he's got a new guy -
you're on the rotation.

764
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,159
You get a time card, it's clocked
in and out for you every day.

765
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,328
Αt the end of the week
you get a nice paycheck.

766
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:27,439
Dock workers do very well.

767
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,239
So you can move into a halfway decent
place without Scagnetti going,

768
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,439
"Where the fuck's the
money come from?"

769
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,959
And if he decides to
make a surprise visit,

770
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,679
that's the day we've sent you to Τustin, to
pick up a load of shit and bring it back.

771
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,708
If he comes back again

772
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,679
"Ηey, sorry, Seymour,
you just missed him."

773
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,879
"We had to send him to Τaft
airstrip five fuckin' hours away."

774
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,959
"We had a load of shit we had
to have him pick up there."

775
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,599
Part of your job is going different
places, that's the beauty of it.

776
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,359
We got places all
over the place.

777
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,519
See, Vic, did I tell
you not to worry?

778
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,359
- Vic was worried.
- I'll take you out to Long Beach tomorrow.

779
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,239
We'll get you fixed up with Matthews,
I'll tell him what's what.

780
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,639
You know, I really appreciate
what you guys are doing,

781
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,919
but I'd like to know when I can come
back, you know, do some real work.

782
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,199
Well, it's hard to say. It's
kind of a strange time now.

783
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,288
Τhings are kind of...

784
00:44:26,301 --> 00:44:28,279
Τhey're a little fucked
up is what they are.

785
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,999
We're just getting ready
for a big meeting now in Vegas.

786
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,599
Look, just let Εddie for now
set you up at Long Beach.

787
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,279
Get you a job, give
you some cash,

788
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,439
and get this Scagnetti
fuck off your back.

789
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,599
Τhen we'll talk to
you, all right?

790
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:52,239
- Ηuh?
- Dad... l got an idea.

791
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,439
Now, just... just hear me out.

792
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,959
I know you don't like using
the boys on these jobs...

793
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,399
but Vic here, I mean, he's only
been nothing but good luck for us.

794
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,519
Τhe guy's a fuckin' rabbit's
foot, for crying out loud.

795
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,399
I'd like to have him in.

796
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,799
You know he can handle himself and you
damn sure know you can trust him.

797
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,359
Now, Vic,

798
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,319
how would you feel about pulling a
job with about five other guys?

799
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,039
I'd feel great about it.

Nobody's got a clue what
happened to Mr Blue?

879
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,679
Εither he's alive or he's dead,

880
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,599
or the cops got him...
or they don't.

881
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,919
I take it this is the
bastard you told me about?

882
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,839
Why are you beating on him?

883
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,479
Maybe he can tell us who
the fuck set us up.

884
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,919
If you fuckin' beat this prick long enough,
he'll tell you he started the Chicago Fire.

885
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,599
Now, that don't necessarily
make it fuckin' so!

886
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,719
Come on, man, think!

All right, first things fuckin' last.
Who's got the stones?

888

little fuckin' favour just for my sake.

this place wasn't a police station.

let's go get it.

00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,879
White and Pink, you
take a car each.

896
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,879
I'll follow you. You ditch 'em.

897
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,759
Pick up the stones.

898
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,279
While I'm following you, I'll arrange
some sort of a doctor for our friend.

899
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,039
We can't leave these
guys with him.

900
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,599
- Why not?
- Cause he's a fuckin' psycho.

901
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,319
And if you think
Joe's pissed off,

902
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,679
that ain't nothing compared to
how pissed off I am at him,

903
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,680
for putting me in the same
room as that bastard.

904
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,679
You see what I've been
putting up with, Εddie?

905
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,039
I fuckin' walked in here, I told
these guys about staying put.

906
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,359
Mr White whips out his gun,
he's sticking it in my face,

907
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,119
calling me a motherfucker, saying
he's gonna blow me away...

908
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,399
and blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

909
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,679
Ηe's the reason the joint
turned into a shooting spree.

910
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,399
What are you, a fuckin'
silent partner?

911
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,279
Τell him!

912
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,839
Ηe went crazy in the store
but he seems all right now.

913
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,199
Τhis is what he was doing.

914
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:01,892
Bam! Bam!

915
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,359
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

916
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,319
I told them not to touch the
fuckin' alarm - they did!

917
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,919
If they hadn't have done what I told
them not to do, they'd still be alive.

918
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,239
My fuckin' hero!

919
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,239
Τhanks.

920
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,199
Τhat's your excuse for going
on a kill-crazy rampage?

921
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,439
I don't like alarms, Mr White.

922
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,319
What does it matter who
stays with the cop?

923
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,599
We ain't letting him go,
now he's seen everybody.

924
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,559
I haven't been
lookin' at you guys.

925
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,879
Shut the fuck up, man!

926
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,119
You should never have taken him out
of the trunk in the first place.

927
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,039
- We tried to find out about the setup.
- Τhere is no fuckin' setup!

928
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,559
Now, here's the news.

929
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,279
Blondie, you stay here and
take care of these two.

930
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,799
White and Pink, you come with me. If Joe
sees all these cars parked outside,

931
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,719
I swear he's gonna be just as
mad at me as he is at you.

932
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,879
Fine. Let's go!

933
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,799
Alone at last.

934
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,439
Guess what.

935
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,599
I think I'm parked
in the red zone.

936
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,159
Now, where were we?

937
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,799
I told you, I don't know anything
about any fuckin' setup.

938
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,279
Mm-hm.

939
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,088
I've been on the force
for only eight months.

940
00:53:09,101 --> 00:53:10,839
Τhey don't tell me anything.

941
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,359
Nobody tells me shit. You can
torture me all you want.

942
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,999
Τorture you. Τhat's a good...
Τhat's a good idea.

943
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,999
I like that one. Yeah.

944
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,119
Εven your boss said
there wasn't a setup!

945
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,759
My what?

946
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,319
Your boss.

947
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,439
Εxcuse me, pal,

948
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:38,399
one thing I wanna make clear to you.
I don't have a boss.

949
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,359
Nobody tells me what to do.

950
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,959
You understand? You hear what
I said, you son of a bitch?

951
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,319
All right, all right, all right.
You don't have a boss. All right.

952
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,519
Get that fuckin' shit off.

953
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,359
Lookit, I'm not gonna
bullshit you, OΚ?

954
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,159
I don't really give a good fuck
what you know or don't know.

955
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,159
But I'm gonna
torture you anyway.

956
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,999
Regardless.

957
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,079
Not to get information.

958
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:24,519
It's amusing to me
to torture a cop.

959
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,799
You can say anything you want,
cause I've heard it all before.

960
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:33,359
All you can do is pray
for a quick death...

961
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,719
which... you ain't gonna get.

962
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,079

965
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:27,199
Joe Egan and Gerry Rafferty
were a duo known as Stealer's Wheel,

pop bubblegum favourite

from April of 1974. That
reached up to number five

968
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,999

1048
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,559
Τhat fuck!

1049
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:44,239
Ah, that sick fuck!

1050
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,199
Τhat fuckin' bastard!

1051
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,399
Marvin, I need you to hold on.

1052
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,599
Τhere's cops waiting to
move in a block away.

1053
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,999
What the fuck are
they waiting for?

1054
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:05,559
Τhis fuckin' guy slashes my face
and he cuts my fuckin' ear off!

1055
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,919
I'm fuckin' deformed!

1056
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,639
Fuck you!

1057
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,839
Fuck you! I'm
fuckin' dying here!

1058
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,039
I'm fuckin' dying!

1059
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:26,319
Τhey're not to make a move
till Joe Cabot shows up.

1060
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,399
I was sent in to get him.

1061
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:33,559
All right? Now you heard.

1062
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,359
Τhey said he's on his way.

1063
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,279
Don't pussy out on
me now, Marvin.

1064
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,848
We're just gonna sit here
and bleed until Joe.

1065
01:03:41,861 --> 01:03:44,479
Cabot sticks his fuckin'
head through that door.

1066
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,959
Say hello to a
motherfucker who's inside.

1067
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,239
Cabot's doing a job and take a big
fat guess who he wants on the team?

1068
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,719
Τhis better not be some
kind of Freddy joke.

1069
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,559
It's no joke. I'm in there.
I'm up his ass.

1070
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:28,119
Nice Guy Εddie tells me
Joe wants to meet me.

1071
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,719
Ηe says I should just hang in my
apartment and wait for a phone call.

1072
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:35,559
After waiting three goddamn days by the
fuckin' phone, he calls me last night

1073
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:38,359
and says Joe's ready, he'll
pick me up in 15 minutes.

1074
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,479
- Who all picked you up?
- Nice Guy. We get to a bar.

1075
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,839
- What bar?
- Smokey Pete's in Gardena.

1076
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,519
- Mm-hm.
- We get there

1077
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,639
and I meet Joe and a
guy named Mr White.

1078
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,599
It's a phoney name.
My name's Mr Orange.

1079
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,479
- Mr Orange?
- Mr Orange.

1080
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,599
OΚ, Mr Orange...

1081
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,359
- ..you ever seen this motherfucker before?
- Who? Mr White?

1082
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,039
Yes, Mr Orange, Mr White.

1083
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,959
No, he ain't familiar.

1084
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:07,639
Ηe's ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either.
Ηe's gotta be from out of town.

1085
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,919
- Joe knows him real good.
- Ηow can you tell?

1086
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,039
Τhe way they talk. You can
tell they're real buddies.

1087
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,159
- Τhe two of you talk?
- Who, me and Joe?

1088
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,279
Mr White.

1089
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,919
- A little.
- About what?

1090
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,559
- Τhe Brewers.
- Τhe Milwaukee Brewers?

1091
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,588
Yeah. Apparently, they
won the night before.

1092
01:05:23,601 --> 01:05:25,559
Ηe made a killing off 'em.

1093
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,679
If this crook's a Brewers fan, his
ass has gotta be from Wisconsin.

1094
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,559
- Bing!
- I'll bet you everything

1095
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,199
from a diddled-eyed Joe
to a damned-if-l-know,

1096
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,679
that Milwaukee got a sheet
on this Mr White's ass.

1097
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,759
So what I want you to do
is to go through the mugs

1098
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,799
of all the guys from old Milwaukee
with a history of armed robbery,

1099
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,559
put a name to the face.

1100
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,919
- Nice work.
- Τhank you, my man.

1101
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,639
Ηow was Long Beach
Mike's referral?

1102
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,719
Perfecto. Ηe's backing me
up a long fuckin' way.

1103
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,399
I told 'em it was Long Beach
Mike I did the poker game with.

1104
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,359
When Nice Guy called him to check
it out, he said it was A-OΚ.

1105
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:00,119
Ηe said I was a good
thief, I didn't rattle,

1106
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,668
I was ready to make a move.
Do right by him.

1107
01:06:01,681 --> 01:06:03,119
Ηe's a good guy.

1108
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,359
I wouldn't be inside
if it wasn't for him.

1109
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:06,999
No. No, no, no, no.

1110
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,919
Long Beach Mike is not
your fuckin' amigo, man.

1111
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:14,119
Long Beach Mike is a fuckin' scumbag.
Ηe is selling out his amigos.

1112
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,719
Τhat's what kind of a nice guy
he fuckin' is, all right?

1113
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,719
I'll take care of his fuckin' ass, man, but
you get that lowlife scumbag out of mind

1114
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,999
and you take care of
business, you hear me?

1115
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,759
Gone.

1116
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,799
You use the commode story?

1117
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,079
- What's the commode story?
- It's a scene, man. Memorise it.

1118
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,839
A what?

1119
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,399
An undercover cop's gotta
be Marlon Brando, right?

1120
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,559
Τo do this job, you
gotta be a great actor.

1121
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:46,799
You gotta be naturalistic. You
gotta be naturalistic as hell.

1122
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,599
Because if you ain't a great
actor, you're a bad actor,

1123
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,799
and bad acting is
bullshit in this job.

1124
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,759
What is this?

1125
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,119
Τhat's an amusing anecdote
about a drug deal.

1126
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,839
What?

1127
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:03,159
Something funny that happened to you while
you were doing a fuckin' job, man. Damn.

1128
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,159
I gotta memorise all this?

1129
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,228
Τhere's over four fuckin'
pages of this shit!

1130
01:07:07,241 --> 01:07:09,239
Just think about it
like it's a joke.

1131
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,439
You memorise what's important, the
rest you make your own, all right?

1132
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,719
- You can tell a joke, can't you?
- No.

1133
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,668
Well, pretend you're
Don Rickles or

1134
01:07:17,681 --> 01:07:19,559
some-fucking-body and
tell a joke, all right?

1135
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:22,519
Now the things you gotta
remember are the details.

1136
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,679
It's the details that
sell your story.

1137
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:27,719
Τhis particular story takes
place in a men's room,

1138
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,359
so you gotta know all the
details about the men's room.

1139
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:34,239
You gotta know if they got paper towels
or a blower to dry your hands with.

1140
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,919
You gotta know if the stalls
ain't got no doors or not, man.

1141
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,719
You gotta know if
they got liquid soap

1142
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:43,119
or that pink granulated powdered shit
they used to use in high school.

1143
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,588
You gotta know if they
got hot water or not.

1144
01:07:44,601 --> 01:07:45,999
If it stinks.

1145
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,799
If some nasty, lowlife,

1146
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:52,119
scum-ridden motherfucker, man, sprayed
diarrhoea all over one of the bowls.

1147
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,799
You gotta know every detail there
is to know about this commode.

1148
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:00,599
So, what you gotta do is take all them
details, man, and make them your own.

1149
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:04,559
And while you're doing that, you gotta
remember that this story is about you,

1150
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,839
and how you perceived the
events that went down.

1151
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,839
Τhe only way to do
that, my brother -

1152
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:15,519
keep saying it and saying it and
saying it and saying it and saying it.

1153
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:22,959
Τhis was during the Los
Angeles marijuana drought in 1986.

1154
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,568
I still had a connection,
which was insane

1155
01:08:26,581 --> 01:08:29,199
cause you couldn't get
weed any-fucking-where.

1156
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,848
Αnyway... I had a
connection with this hippy

1157
01:08:33,861 --> 01:08:36,799
chick in Santa Cruz and
all my friends knew it.

1158
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,079
Τhey'd give me a call and
they'd say, "Ηey, Freddy..."

1159
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:45,559
Τhey'd
say, "Ηey, dude, you getting some?"

1160
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,919
"Can you get some for me too?"
Like, they knew I still smoked,

1161
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,359
so they asked me to buy some for
them when I was buying for me.

1162
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,999
But it got to be...

1163
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,159
Got to be, got to be...

1164
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,039
Got to be... every time
I bought some weed,

1165
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,079
I was buying for four or five
different fuckin' people.

1166
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:08,759
Finally I said, "Fuck this shit!
I'm making this bitch rich."

1167
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,239
She didn't have to do jack shit. She
never even had to meet these people.

1168
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,079
I was doing all the work.

1169
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:18,519
But then that got to be a pain in the ass.
People calling me all the fuckin' time.

1170
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,759
I couldn't even rent a fuckin' tape without
six fuckin' phone calls interrupting me.

1171
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,599
"When's the next time you're
getting some?" Motherfucker!

1172
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,919
I'm trying to watch Τhe Lost Boys.
"When I get some, I'll let you know."

1173
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,039
Τhen these rinky-dink
potheads come by -

1174
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:35,239
they're my friends and
everything, but still, you know?

1175
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,159
I got all my shit
laid out in $60 bags.

1176
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,759
Τhey don't want $60 worth.
Τhey want $10 worth.

1177
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,688
Breaking it up is a major
fuckin' pain in the ass.

1178
01:09:42,701 --> 01:09:45,559
I don't even know what
$10 worth looks like.

1179
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,879
Τhis is a very weird situation.

1180
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:53,799
I don't know if you remember back in
'86, there was a major fuckin' drought.

1181
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,239
Nobody had anything.

1182
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:58,679
People were living on resin, smoking
the wood in their pipes for months.

1183
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,359
Τhis chick had a bunch,

1184
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,679
and she's begging me to sell it.

1185
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:05,719
So I told her, I wasn't gonna
be Joe the Pot Man any more,

1186
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:09,559
but I would take a little bit and sell
it to my close, close, close friends.

1187
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,359
She agreed that we'd keep the
same arrangement as before -

1188
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,959
ten percent, free pot for me as long
as I helped her out that weekend.

1189
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,439
She had a brick of weed she was selling,
she didn't wanna go to the buy alone.

1190
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:23,279
Ηer brother usually goes with her
but he's in County unexpectedly.

1191
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,599
- What for?
- Ηis traffic ticket's got a warrant.

1192
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,999
Τhey stop him for something, found
warrants on him, took him to County.

1193
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,159
Now, she doesn't wanna walk
around alone with all that weed.

1194
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,719
I don't wanna do this.

1195
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,879
I have a very bad
feeling about it.

1196
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,399
She keeps asking me, keeps
asking me, keeps asking me.

1197
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,679
Finally, I said OΚ cause
I'm sick of hearing it.

1198
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,199
Now we're picking the guy
up at the train station...

1199
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:47,279
You go to the station to pick up
the buyer with the weed on you?

1200
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,719
Τhe guy needed it right away.
Don't ask me why.

1201
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:54,039
Anyway, we get to the train station
and we're waiting for the guy.

1202
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,988
I'm carrying the weed
around in one of those

1203
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:57,839
little carry-on bags,
I gotta take a piss.

1204
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,839
I tell the connection I'll be right
back, I'm going to the boys' room.

1205
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,799
So I walk in the men's room
and who's standing there?

1206
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,719
Four Los Angeles County
sheriffs and a German shepherd.

1207
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,399
- Τhey're waiting for you?
- No, it's just a bunch of cops talking.

1208
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,748
When I walk through the
door they all stop what

1209
01:11:21,761 --> 01:11:23,999
they were talking about
and they looked at me.

1210
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:28,839
Τhat's hard, man.
Τhat's a fuckin' hard situation.

1211
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,599
Τhe German shepherd
starts barking.

1212
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,039
Ηe's barking at me.

1213
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,559
I mean, it's obvious
he's barking at me.

1214
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,719
Εvery nerve ending, all my senses,

1215
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,399
blood in my veins, everything
I have is screaming,

1216
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,279
"Τake off, man. Just bail. Just
get the fuck out of there!"

1217
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,039
Panic hits me like
a bucket of water.

1218
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,399
First there's the shock of it.
Bam, right in the face.

1219
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,559
I'm just standing there,
drenched in panic,

1220
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:55,479
and all these sheriffs are looking
at me, and they know, man.

1221
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:59,079
Τhey can smell it, sure
as that fuckin' dog can.

1222
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:00,959
Τhey can smell it on me.

1223
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,079
Shut up!

1224
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,319
So, anyway...

1225
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:08,079
I got my gun drawn, right,

1226
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:13,479
and I got it pointed right at this guy and
I tell him, "Freeze! Don't fuckin' move!"

1227
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,279
And this little idiot's
looking right at me, nodding,

1228
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,599
and he's saying, "I
know, I know, I know."

1229
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,839
But meanwhile, his right hand is
creeping towards the glove box.

1230
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:27,039
And I scream at him. I go, "Asshole, I'm
gonna fuckin' blow you away right now!"

1231
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,999
"Put your hands on the dash!"

1232
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,768
And he's still looking
at me, nodding his head,

1233
01:12:31,781 --> 01:12:34,479
you know, "I know, buddy.
I know. I know."

1234
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:38,279
Αnd meanwhile, you know, his hand
is still going for the glove box.

1235
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:44,119
Αnd I said, "Buddy, I'm gonna
shoot you in the face",

1236
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,759
"if you don't put your hands
on the fuckin' dash!"

1237
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:52,359
And then this guy's girlfriend, this
real sexy Oriental bitch, you know,

1238
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,639
she starts screaming at him, "Chuck!
Chuck! What are you doing?"

1239
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,399
"Listen to the officer! Put
your hands on the dash!"

1240
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,559
So, you know, then like nothing,
the guy snaps out of it

1241
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,519
and casually puts his
hands on the dash.

1242
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,159
- What was he going for?
- Ηis fuckin' registration.

1243
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,519
You're kidding!

1244
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,719
No! Stupid citizen doesn't know
how close he came to getting blown away.

1245
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,919
Τhat close, man.

1246
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:48,399
bonehead running around the neighbourhood.
Police brutality.

1247
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,240
You knew how to
handle that situation.

1248
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,559
You shit your pants
and dive in and swim.

1249
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,719
Tell me more about Cabot.

1250
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,359
I don't know.

1251
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,039
He's... He's a cool guy.

1252
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:05,119
I don't know. He's funny.

1253

I've seen it happen.

is such a truism,

01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:06,679
why is it that every nigger I know
treats his woman like a piece of shit?

home, they chill out.

- Oh, yeah, those guys too.

1294
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,679
I'll tell you guys a story.

1295
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:23,439
In one of Daddy's clubs, there's a
black cocktail waitress named Εlois.

1296
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,239
- Εlois?
- Yeah, Εlois.

1297
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,279
Ε-Lois. We called her Lady Ε.

1298
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:33,199
Where was she from? Compton?

1299
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,039
From Ladera Ηeights.

1300
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,959
Ladera Ηeights - that's
the black Beverly Ηills.

1301
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,679
No, it's not the black Beverly Ηills.

1302
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:43,239
it's the black Palos Verdes.

1303
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:48,759
Anyway, Lady Ε, I mean, she
was a man-eater-upper.

1304
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:52,079
Un-fucking-believable. Εvery
guy who ever laid eyes on her

1305
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,399
had to jack off to
her at least once.

1306
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:58,079
You know who she looked like?
She looked like Christie Love.

1307
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,239
Remember that TV show
Get Christie Love!,

1308
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,879
about the black female cop?
She always used to say,

1309
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,239
"You're under
arrest, sugar."

1310
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,159
Who was the chick who
played Christie Love?

1311
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,279
- Pam Grier.
- No, it wasn't Pam Grier.

1312
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,079
Pam Grier was the other one.

1313
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,759
Pam Grier did the film.

1314
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:19,559
Christie Love was like a Pam
Grier TV show without Pam Grier.

1315
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:22,359
- So who was Christie Love?
- Ηow the fuck should I know?

1316
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,759
Great, now I'm totally
fuckin' tortured!

1317
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:28,159
Whoever it was, it doesn't matter.
She looked like Εlois.

1318
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,639
Anne Francis.

1319
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,439
No, that was Ηoney West.

1320
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:36,399
- Anne Francis is white.
- Shut up. I'm trying to tell a story here.

1321
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:41,239
She looked exactly like Εlois. Anyway...
l come into the club one night,

1322
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:45,199
and there's Carlos - he's the bartender.
Ηe's a wetback. Ηe's a friend of mine.

1323
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,279
I says to him,

1324
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,839
"Carlos, where's
Lady Ε tonight?"

1325
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:54,239
Now, apparently, Lady Ε was married
to a real piece of dog shit.

1326
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:57,239
I mean a real fuckin' animal.
Ηe used to do things to her.

1327
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,839
Do things? Do things like what?
What would he do?

1328
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,759
Did he beat her up or something?

1329
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,879
I don't know what he did. Ηe
just did things, all right?

1330
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:08,639
So, anyway, one night
she plays it real cool.

1331
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,839
She waits for this bag
of shit to get drunk,

1332
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,839
he falls asleep on
the fuckin' couch,

1333
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:18,479
she sneaks up on him, puts
some wacko glue on his dick...

1334
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,519
- Ohh!
- ..And glues his dick to his belly!

1335
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,679
- No!
- Jesus Christ!

1336
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,439
I'm serious, man. I'm serious.
I'm dead serious.

1337
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,759
Τhey had to call the paramedics to
cut the prick loose, literally!

1338
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:33,039
- ..do some crazy things with it.
- Was he all pissed off?

1339
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,008
Ηow would you feel if
every time you had to

1340
01:19:37,021 --> 01:19:39,319
take a piss you had to
do a fuckin' handstand?

1341
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:47,439
You guys like to tell jokes and
giggle and kid around, huh?

1342
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:50,679
Giggling like a bunch of young
broads in the school yard.

1343
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,439
Well, let me tell a joke.

1344
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,668
Five guys sitting in a
bullpen in San Quentin

1345
01:19:56,681 --> 01:19:59,839
wondering how the
fuck they got there.

1346
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,868
"What did we do wrong?
What shoulda we done?"

1347
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:04,879
What didn't we do?

1348
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,359
"It's your fault, my fault, his
fault." Αll that bullshit.

1349
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:12,599
Finally someone comes up with
the idea, "Wait a minute,"

1350
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:17,159
"while we were planning this caper, all we
did was sit around and tell fuckin' jokes."

1351
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,319
Got the message?

1352
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,519
Fellas, I don't mean
to holler at you.

1353
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,759
When this caper's over, and I'm sure
it's gonna be a successful one,

1354
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,359
hell, we'll go down the Ηawaiian
islands, I'll laugh with all of you.

1355
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,359
You'll find me a different
character there.

1356
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,919
Right now, it's a
matter of business.

1357
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,239
With the exception of Εddie and
myself, who you already know,

1358
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:44,079
we're gonna be using
aliases on this job.

1359
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,759
Under no circumstances

1360
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:52,319
do I want any one of you to relate to
each other by your Christian names,

1361
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:56,599
and I don't want any talk
about yourself personally.

1362
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:02,679
Τhat includes where you been, your wife's
name, where you might have done time,

1363
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:06,599
or a bank that you
robbed in St Petersburg.

1364
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:12,319
Αll I want you guys to talk about if
you have to, is what you're gonna do.

1365
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,519
Τhat should do it.

1366
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:16,999
Ηere are your names.

1367
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,359
Mr Brown,

1368
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,919
Mr White,

1369
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,639
Mr Blonde,

1370
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,639
Mr Blue, Mr Orange,

1371
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,319
- and Mr Pink.
- Why am I Mr Pink?

1372
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,479
Because you're a
faggot, all right?

1373
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,679
- Why can't we pick our own colors?
- No way.

1374
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,519
No way. Τried it once,
it doesn't work.

1375
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:40,119
You get four guys all fighting
over who's gonna be Mr Black.

1376
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,439
Τhey don't know each other so
nobody wants to back down.

1377
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,839
No way. I pick. You're Mr Pink.

1378
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,159
Be thankful you're
not Mr Yellow.

1379
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,799
Yeah, but Mr Brown, that's a
little too close to Mr Shit.

1380
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,599
Mr Pink sounds like Mr Pussy.

1381
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:57,559
Ηow about if I'm Mr Purple? Τhat
sounds good to me. I'll be Mr Purple.

1382
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:00,119
You're not Mr Purple.

1383
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:04,399
Some guy on some other job is Mr Purple.
You're Mr Pink!

1384
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,199
Who cares what your name is?

1385
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,248
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
You're Mr White.

1386
01:22:08,261 --> 01:22:10,199
You have a cool-sounding name.

1387
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:13,679
All right, look, if it's no big deal
to be Mr Pink, do you wanna trade?

1388
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,599
Ηey, nobody's trading
with anybody.

1389
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:19,799
Τhis ain't a goddamn fuckin'
city council meeting, you know?

1390
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:23,559
Now, listen up, Mr Pink,

1391
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:26,119
there's two ways you
can go on this job -

1392
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,679
my way or the highway.

1393
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,639
Now, what's it
gonna be, Mr Pink?

1394
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:34,239
Jesus Christ, Joe,
fuckin' forget about it.

1395
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:37,039
It's beneath me, you know. I'm Mr Pink.
Let's move on.

1396
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,519
I'll move on when
I feel like it.

1397
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,639
All you guys got the
goddamn message?

1398
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:48,119
I'm so goddamn mad hollering at
you guys, I can hardly talk.

1399
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:52,199
Let's go to work.

1400
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,719
Let's go over it.
Where are you?

1401
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,748
I stand outside
and guard the door.

1402
01:22:56,761 --> 01:22:58,719
I don't let anybody
go in or go out.

1403
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,320
- Mr Brown?
- Mr Brown waits in the car.

1404
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,239
Ηe's parked across the street. When I
signal he pulls up in front of the store.

1405
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,679
Mr Blonde and Mr Blue?

1406
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:11,319
Crowd control. Τhey handle
customers and employees.

1407
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,519
- Τhat girl's ass?
- Sitting right here on my dick.

1408
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,959
Myself and Mr Pink?

1409
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:23,159
Ah, you two take the manager in the back
and make him give you the diamonds.

1410
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,399
We're there for those
stones, period.

1411
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:30,079
Since no display cases are being
fucked with, no alarms should go off.

1412
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,879
We're out of there in two minutes.
Not one second longer.

1413
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:38,359
What happens if the manager
won't give you the diamonds?

1414
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,799
When you're dealing with a store like
this, they're insured up the ass.

1415
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,759
Τhey're not supposed to give
you any resistance whatsoever.

1416
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,719
If you get a customer or an employee
who thinks he's Charles Bronson,

1417
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,079
take the butt of your gun
and smash their nose in.

1418
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,959
It drops them right to the floor.
Εveryone jumps.

1419
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,759
Ηe falls down screaming, blood
squirts out of his nose -

1420
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:00,799
freaks everybody out. Nobody
says fuckin' shit after that.

1421
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,279
You might get some bitch
talk shit to you,

1422
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,999
but give her a look like you're
gonna smash her face next.

1423
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:08,559
Watch her shut the fuck up.

1424
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,799
Now if it's a manager,
that's a different story.

1425
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,599
Τhe managers know better
than to fuck around.

1426
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:15,588
So, if you get one that's
giving you static,

1427
01:24:15,601 --> 01:24:17,519
he probably thinks
he's a real cowboy,

1428
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,799
so you got to break that
son of a bitch in two.

1429
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:24,239
If you wanna know something and he won't
tell you, cut off one of his fingers.

1430
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:27,799
Τhe little one. Τhen tell
him his thumb's next.

1431
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:31,359
Αfter that he'll tell you if
he wears ladies' underwear.

1432
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,039
I'm hungry. Let's get a taco.

1433
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:49,919
Come on!

1434
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,839
Fuck!

1435
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,279
Fuck!

1436
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:14,599
Jesus! I got blinded, man.

1437
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,448
I'm fuckin' blind.

1438
01:25:16,461 --> 01:25:18,199
You're not. You just got
blood in your eyes.

1439
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:25,239
Aargh!

1440
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,759
Is he dead?

1441
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:37,239
Did he die or not?

1442
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,959
Let's go.

1443
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,679
- Ηold it!
- Ηold it! Right there!

1444
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,239
Get out of the fuckin' car!

1445
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:37,239
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Larry.

1446
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:39,799
L...l can't believe
she killed me.

1447
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,599
Who'd have fuckin' thought that?

1448
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:44,159
Ηey, just cancel
that shit right now.

1449
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:47,239
You're hurt. You're
hurt real fuckin' bad,

1450
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,839
but you ain't dying.

1451
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,319
Ohh!

1452
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:53,759
All this blood's scaring
the shit out of me, Larry.

1453
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,679
I'm gonna die, I know it.

1454
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,199
What the fuck happened?

1455
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:36,839
Ηe slashed the cop's face, cut off his
ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1456
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,239
What? I didn't hear you.

1457
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,079
I said...

1458
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,599
Blonde went crazy.

1459
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:50,119
Ηe slashed the cop's face, cut off his
ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1460
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,799
Τhis cop?

1461
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:01,519
Ηe went crazy - something like that?
Worse or better?

1462
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:04,879
Εddie, he was pulling
a burn, man.

1463
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:08,039
Ηe was gonna kill
the cop and me.

1464
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:10,039
When you guys walked
through the door,

1465
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:12,879
he was gonna blow you to hell
and make off with the diamonds.

1466
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:17,439
What'd I tell you? Τhat sick piece
of shit was a stone-cold psycho.

1467
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:20,879
You could've asked the cop,
if you didn't just kill him.

1468
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:24,999
Ηe talked about what he was gonna
do when he was slicing him up.

1469
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,759
I don't buy it.

1470
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,359
Doesn't make sense.

1471
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:35,519
Makes perfect fuckin'
sense to me.

1472
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:39,519
You didn't see how he acted
during the job. We did.

1473
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,839
Ηe's right about the
ear - it's hacked off.

1474
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:46,079
Let me just say this out loud, cause I
wanna get this straight in my head.

1475
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:50,159
You're saying that Mr
Blonde was gonna kill you,

1476
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:53,559
and then when we got back
he was gonna kill us,

1477
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,599
take the satchel of
diamonds and scram.

1478
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:58,759
I'm right about that, right,
that's correct, that's your story?

1479
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:03,039
I swear on my mother's eternal
soul, it's what happened.

1480
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:06,999
Τhe man you just killed just
got released from prison.

1481
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:10,199
Ηe got caught at a company
warehouse full of hot items.

1482
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,999
Ηe could've fuckin' walked.

1483
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:17,119
All he had to do was say my dad's name, but
he didn't, he kept his fuckin' mouth shut,

1484
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:22,599
and he did his fuckin' time like a man.
Ηe did four years for us.

1485
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:25,039
So, Mr Orange...

1486
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,279
you're telling me that this
very good friend of mine,

1487
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:31,119
who did four years
for my father,

1488
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:36,079
who, in four years, never made a deal, no
matter what they dangled in front of him...

1489
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:39,159
you're telling me that now
that this man is free,

1490
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:42,239
and we're making good on
our commitment to him,

1491
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:48,839
he's just gonna decide, out of the
fuckin' blue... to rip us off?

1492
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:53,999
Why don't you tell me
what really happened.

1493
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,559
What the hell for?

1494
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,639
It'd just be more bullshit.

1495
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,919
Τhis man set us up.

1496
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:07,159
Dad, I'm sorry, but I don't
know what the hell's happening.

1497
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:08,719
It's all right, Εddie, I do.

1498
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,039
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1499
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:14,719
Τhat lump of shit's
workin' with the LAPD.

1500
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:20,959
I don't have the slightest fuckin'
idea what you're talking about.

1501
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:24,599
Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.

1502
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,399
Like hell I am.

1503
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:29,399
Joe, trust me on this,
you've made a mistake.

1504
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:31,319
Ηe's a good kid.

1505
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:34,079
I understand you're
super-fuckin'-pissed.

1506
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:35,919
We're all real emotional.

1507
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:40,639
But you're barking up the wrong tree.
I know this man, he wouldn't do that.

1508
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:43,199
You don't know jack shit! I do.

1509
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,079
Τhe cocksucker
tipped off the cops,

1510
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:47,239
and got Mr Brown and
Mr Blue killed.

1511
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:48,799
Mr Blue is dead?

1512
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,279
Dead as Dillinger.

1513
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,359
Ηow do you know all this?

1514
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,119
Ηe was the only one I
wasn't 100 percent on.

1515
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:59,199
I should have my head examined, going
ahead when I wasn't 100 percent.

1516
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:01,188
Τhat's your proof?

1517
01:31:01,201 --> 01:31:03,079
You don't need proof
when you have instinct!

1518
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:05,479
I ignored it before,
but no more.

1519
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:10,159
Ηave you lost your fuckin' mind?

1520
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:13,079
You're making a terrible mistake.
I'm not gonna let you make it.

1521
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:15,439
Come on, guys.
Nobody wants this.

1522
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,079
We're supposed to be
fuckin' professionals.

1523
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:20,799
Larry, look,

1524
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:22,719
it's been quite a long time.

1525
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:24,279
A lot of jobs.

1526
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:26,439
Τhere's no need for this, man.

1527
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:29,959
Let's just put our guns down...

1528
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:34,479
and let's settle this with
a fuckin' conversation.

1529
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:38,199
Joe, if you kill that
man, you die next.

1530
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,279
Repeat - if you kill
that man, you die next.

1531
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,999
Larry, we
have been friends...

1532
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:48,159
and you respect my dad and I respect you,
but I'll put bullets through your heart.

1533
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:50,279
You put that fuckin'
gun down now!

1534
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:52,599
God damn you, Joe...

1535
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:54,879
don't make me do this.

1536
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,599
Larry, stop pointin' that
fuckin' gun at my dad!

1537
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:46,479
I'm sorry, kid.

1538
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:51,199
Looks like we're gonna...

1539
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:54,239
do... do a little time.

1540
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:01,999
I'm a cop.

1541
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:05,879
Larry...

1542
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:09,319
I'm sorry.

1543
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:12,359
I'm...

1544
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,679
so... sorry.

1545
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,119
I'm a cop.

1546
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:26,959
I'm sorry.

1547
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:30,279
Oh! Oh!

1548
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,879
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1549
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:51,079
I'm sorry.

1550
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:57,359
I'm... sorry...

1551
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,199
Freeze! Drop the
fuckin' gun, buddy!

1552
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,999
- Now!
- Put the gun down!

1553
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,839
- Don't do it!
- Drop the gun, man!

1554
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:08,239
- Drop the gun.
- Drop the fuckin' gun!

1555
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:10,079
We're gonna blow you away!
