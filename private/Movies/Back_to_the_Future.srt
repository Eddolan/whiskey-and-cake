1
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,200
October is inventory time.

2
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,639
So right now, Statler Toyota is making
the best deals of the year...

3
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:33,799
...on all 1985-model Toyotas.

4
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,559
You won't find a better car...

5
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,199
...at a better price with better service
anywhere in Hill Valley.

6
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,438
The Senate is expected
to vote on this today.

7
00:01:47,598 --> 00:01:51,558
In other news, officials at
the Pacific Nuclear research facility...

8
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,637
...have denied the rumor
that a case of missing plutonium...

9
00:01:54,797 --> 00:01:57,437
...was in fact stolen
from their vault two weeks ago.

10
00:01:57,677 --> 00:02:01,157
A Libyan terrorist group had claimed
responsibility for the alleged theft.

11
00:02:01,397 --> 00:02:05,996
However, officials now attribute
the discrepancy to a simple clerical error.

12
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:09,636
The FBI, which is investigating the matter,
had no comment.

13
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:50,992
Doc?

14
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,672
Doc?

15
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:57,751
Hello! Anybody home?

16
00:02:57,951 --> 00:02:59,151
Einstein, come here, boy.

17
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,231
What's going on? God.

18
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:04,951
Jesus!

19
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:07,310
That is disgusting.

20
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,943
Rock 'n' roll.

21
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:40,542
Yo.
Marty, is that you?

22
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,581
Doc. Where are you?

23
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,901
Thank God I've found you. Meet me
at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15.

24
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:48,421
I made a breakthrough.
I'll need your assistance.

25
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,581
1:15 in the morning?
Doc, what's going on?

26
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:53,660
Where you been all week?
Working.

27
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,660
Is Einstein with you?
Yeah, he's right here.

28
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,140
You left your equipment on all week.

29
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,700
My equipment. That reminds me, Marty.

30
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,499
Do not hook up to the amplifier.
There's a slight possibility of overload.

31
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,859
Yeah. I'll keep that in mind.

32
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:10,179
Good. I'll see you tonight. Don't forget.

33
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:13,059
1:15 a. m., Twin Pines Mall.
Right.

34
00:05:19,578 --> 00:05:23,817
Are those my clocks I hear?
Yeah, it's 8:00.

35
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:26,417
Perfect! My experiment worked!

36
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:29,457
They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!

37
00:05:29,977 --> 00:05:32,257
Wait a minute, Doc.

38
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:34,496
Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

39
00:05:34,696 --> 00:05:36,776
Precisely.
Damn!

40
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:39,496
I'm late for school.

41
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:39,170
Jennifer.
- Strickland's looking for you.

42
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,810
If you get caught,
it'll be four tardies in a row.

43
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,610
All right, come on. I think we're safe.

44
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:50,009
This time it wasn't my fault.
The doc set all his clocks 25 minutes slow.

45
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:51,409
The doc?

46
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:55,409
Am I to understand you're still hanging
around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?

47
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:58,249
Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker.

48
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:01,848
And one for you, McFly.
I believe that's four in a row.

49
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,208
Let me give you a nickel's worth
o"f f"ree advice, young man.

50
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:08,328
This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous.
He's a real nutcase.

51
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,967
Hang around with him,
you'll end up in big trouble.

52
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:12,607
Yes, sir.

53
00:07:12,847 --> 00:07:15,767
You got a real attitude problem.
You're a slacker.

54
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:20,166
You remind me of your father
when he went here. He was a slacker, too.

55
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,486
Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?

56
00:07:22,686 --> 00:07:26,006
Your band is on the roster for
the dance auditions after school today.

57
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:28,406
Why even bother?
You don't have a chance.

58
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:30,406
You're too much like your old man.

59
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:34,205
No McFly ever amounted to anything
in the history of Hill Valley.

60
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,245
Yeah, well, history is going to change.

61
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:41,724
Next, please.

62
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:52,123
All right.

63
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,563
We're the Pinheads.

64
00:07:56,963 --> 00:07:58,323
One, two, three.

65
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:20,001
Okay, that's enough. Thank you, fellas.

66
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:22,161
Hold it, fellas.

67
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:24,800
I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.

68
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,040
Next, please.

69
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,960
Next group, please.

70
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,999
Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson.

71
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,079
Progress is his middle name.

72
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:39,959
"Too loud. " I can't believe it.

73
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,679
We'll never get a chance
to play in front of anybody.

74
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:45,118
Marty, one rejection
isn't the end of the world.

75
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:47,438
I just don't think I'm cut out for music.

76
00:08:47,638 --> 00:08:50,958
But you're really good,
and your audition tape is great.

77
00:08:51,158 --> 00:08:53,278
You've got to send it in
to the record company.

78
00:08:53,478 --> 00:08:55,117
- It's like Doc's always saying.
- I know.

79
00:08:55,277 --> 00:08:58,237
If you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

80
00:08:58,757 --> 00:09:00,437
That's good advice.

81
00:09:00,597 --> 00:09:03,997
All right. What if I send in the tape
and they don't like it?

82
00:09:04,237 --> 00:09:05,996
What if they say I'm no good?

83
00:09:06,156 --> 00:09:08,076
What if they say, "You got no future"?

84
00:09:08,236 --> 00:09:10,396
I can't take that kind of rejection.

85
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:13,396
I'm starting to sound like my old man.

86
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:15,396
- He's not that bad.
- Save the clock tower.

87
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,115
He's letting you borrow the car
tomorrow night.

88
00:09:19,355 --> 00:09:21,115
Check out that 4x4.

89
00:09:21,715 --> 00:09:24,155
That is hot.
Back her up.

90
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,474
Someday, Jennifer. Someday.

91
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,954
Wouldn't it be great
to take that truck up to the lake?

92
00:09:32,394 --> 00:09:34,954
Throw a couple of sleeping bags
in the back.

93
00:09:36,554 --> 00:09:38,353
Lie out underneath the stars.

94
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:40,193
- Stop it.
- What?

95
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:43,393
Does your mom know?
About tomorrow night?

96
00:09:43,553 --> 00:09:47,273
No, get out of town. My mom thinks
I'm going camping with the guys.

97
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:50,272
My mother would freak out
if she knew I was going with you.

98
00:09:50,472 --> 00:09:52,272
I'd get the standard lecture about...

99
00:09:52,432 --> 00:09:54,832
...how she never did that stuff
when she was a kid.

100
00:09:55,032 --> 00:09:57,552
Look, I think the woman was born a nun.

101
00:09:57,752 --> 00:10:00,231
She's just trying to keep you respectable.

102
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:02,431
She's not doing a very good job.

103
00:10:02,591 --> 00:10:03,751
Terrible.

104
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:07,191
Save the clock tower.
Save the clock tower.

105
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:11,150
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring
an initiative to replace that clock.

106
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,430
Thirty years ago, lightning struck that
clock tower and the clock hasn't run since.

107
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:20,109
We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society
think it should be preserved the way it is...

108
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:22,349
...as part of our history and heritage.

109
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:24,189
There's a quarter.
- Thanks.

110
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:26,109
Don't forget to take a flyer.

111
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:28,029
Save the clock tower!

112
00:10:29,868 --> 00:10:30,828
Where were we?

113
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:34,108
Right about here.
- Jennifer!

114
00:10:36,988 --> 00:10:39,148
It's my dad. I've got to go.

115
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:40,547
I'll call you tonight.

116
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:41,827
I'll be at my grandma's.

117
00:10:41,987 --> 00:10:44,187
Here, let me give you the number.

118
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,027
'Bye.

119
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:34,302
Bravo, Tango, Delta 6-2-9.

120
00:11:34,502 --> 00:11:37,022
Tow for impoundment.
Any unit, please respond.

121
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,102
Perfect. Just perfect.

122
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:50,421
I can't believe you'd loan me your car...

123
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:52,581
...without telling me it had a blind spot.

124
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:54,181
I could've been killed.

125
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,660
Now, Biff, I never noticed...

126
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,340
...that the car had any blind spot before
when I would drive it.

127
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,900
Hi, son.

128
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,660
Are you blind, McFly?

129
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,899
How else do you explain
that wreck out there?

130
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:09,099
Biff, can I assume...

131
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:12,139
...that your insurance
is going to pay for the damage?

132
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:14,499
My insurance? It's your car.

133
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:17,338
Your insurance should pay.
Who's going to pay for this?

134
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:21,258
I spilled beer when the car smashed
into me. Who'll pay my cleaning bill?

135
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:23,298
And where's my reports?

136
00:12:23,418 --> 00:12:27,377
I haven't finished those up yet,
but I figured since they weren't due 'til-

137
00:12:27,617 --> 00:12:30,337
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

138
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:33,337
Think, McFly. Think!

139
00:12:33,537 --> 00:12:35,297
I got to have time to get them retyped.

140
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:39,336
Do you realize what would happen
if I hand in my reports in your handwriting?

141
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:41,056
I'll get fired.

142
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:43,656
You wouldn't want that to happen,
would you?

143
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:45,616
- Would you?
- Of course not.

144
00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:48,055
I wouldn't want that to happen.

145
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,535
Now, look.
I'll finish those reports tonight...

146
00:12:50,695 --> 00:12:53,695
...and I'll run them on over
first thing tomorrow.

147
00:12:53,935 --> 00:12:55,775
Not too early. I sleep in Saturday.

148
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,694
Your shoe's untied.

149
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:00,294
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

150
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:02,254
Got the place fixed up nice.

151
00:13:04,294 --> 00:13:06,254
I have your car towed to your house...

152
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,653
...and all you got for me is lite beer?

153
00:13:15,573 --> 00:13:17,573
What are you looking at, butthead?

154
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:21,612
Say hi to your mom for me.

155
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:26,412
I know what you're going to say, son...

156
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,092
...and you're right.

157
00:13:28,252 --> 00:13:29,531
You're right.

158
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:31,091
But...

159
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:33,771
Biff just happens to be my supervisor...

160
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:38,371
...and I'm afraid I'm just not
very good at confrontations.

161
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:41,130
But the car, Dad.

162
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,090
I mean, he wrecked it.
He totaled it.

163
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,290
I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad.

164
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,449
Do you have any idea
how important this was to me?

165
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:54,009
I know, and all I can say is, I'm...

166
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:56,089
I'm sorry.

167
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:58,409
Believe me, Marty, you're better off...

168
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:01,448
...without having to worry
about all the aggravation...

169
00:14:01,648 --> 00:14:04,648
...and headaches of playing at that dance.

170
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:08,488
He's absolutely right.
The last thing you need is headaches.

171
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:19,807
Kids, we're going to have to
eat this cake by ourselves.

172
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,686
Your Uncle Joey didn't make parole again.

173
00:14:25,046 --> 00:14:28,046
It would be nice
if you all dropped him a line.

174
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:29,886
Uncle "Jailbird" Joey?

175
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:31,446
He's your brother, Mom.

176
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:35,045
Yeah. It's a major embarrassment,
having an uncle in prison.

177
00:14:35,445 --> 00:14:37,365
We all make mistakes in life, children.

178
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:39,125
Goddamn it. I'm late.

179
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:40,805
David, watch your mouth!

180
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:43,324
You come here and kiss your mother
before you go.

181
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:46,324
Come on, Mom.
Make it fast. I'll miss my bus.

182
00:14:46,924 --> 00:14:48,004
See you later, Pop.

183
00:14:49,244 --> 00:14:50,964
Time to change that oil.

184
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:54,963
Marty.

185
00:14:55,763 --> 00:14:57,403
I'm not your answering service.

186
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,763
While you were outside
pouting over the car...

187
00:14:59,963 --> 00:15:01,763
...Jennifer Parker called you twice.

188
00:15:01,923 --> 00:15:03,323
I don't like her.

189
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:06,482
Any girl who calls up a boy
is just asking for trouble.

190
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:09,362
Mom. There's nothing wrong
with calling a boy.

191
00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:13,082
I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys.

192
00:15:13,322 --> 00:15:16,361
When I was your age,
I never chased a boy or called a boy or...

193
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:18,921
...sat in a parked car with a boy.

194
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:22,081
Then how am I ever
supposed to meet anybody?

195
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:25,161
Well, it'll just happen.

196
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,600
Like the way I met your father.

197
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,680
That was so stupid.
Grandpa hit him with the car.

198
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,400
It was meant to be.

199
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,920
Anyway...

200
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,519
...if Grandpa hadn't hit him,
then none of you would have been born.

201
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,159
Yeah, well.

202
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:43,519
I don't understand what Dad was doing
in the middle of the street.

203
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:45,959
What was it, George? Bird-watching?

204
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:48,518
What, Lorraine? What?

205
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:51,358
Anyway, your Grandpa
hit him with the car...

206
00:15:51,558 --> 00:15:53,518
...and brought him into the house.

207
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:56,278
He seemed so helpless.

208
00:15:58,997 --> 00:16:01,757
Like a little lost puppy,
and my heart just went out to him.

209
00:16:01,957 --> 00:16:04,877
Yeah, we know.
You've told us this story a million times.

210
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:06,357
You felt sorry for him.

211
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:09,356
You decided to go with him
to the Fish Under the Sea dance.

212
00:16:09,556 --> 00:16:12,356
No. It was
the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.

213
00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:16,196
Our first date. I'll never forget it.

214
00:16:16,756 --> 00:16:20,115
It was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm, remember, George?

215
00:16:22,835 --> 00:16:26,155
Your father kissed me
for the first time on that dance floor.

216
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:30,394
It was then that I realized...

217
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:33,514
...that I was going to spend
the rest of my life with him.

218
00:16:37,154 --> 00:16:38,434
Oh, no.

219
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:02,231
Hello.

220
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:04,831
Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?
Doc.

221
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,631
No. No, don't be silly.

222
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:11,550
Listen, this is very important.
I forgot my video camera.

223
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,390
Can you pick it up at my place
on your way to the mall?

224
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,030
Yeah. I'm on my way.

225
00:17:40,388 --> 00:17:43,187
Einstein! Where's the doc, boy?

226
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:36,462
Doc!

227
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,782
- Marty! You made it!
- Yeah.

228
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:44,182
Welcome to my latest experiment. This is
the one I've been waiting for all my life.

229
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:45,901
Well, it's a DeLorean-

230
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:49,621
All your questions will be answered.
Roll tape and we'll proceed.

231
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:52,061
- Is that a Devo suit?
- Never mind that now.

232
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:54,261
Not now.
- I'm ready.

233
00:18:54,981 --> 00:18:58,620
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.
I'm in the Twin Pines Mall parking lot.

234
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,140
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 a. m.

235
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,420
This is temporal experiment number one.

236
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,339
Come on, Einie. Get in there.

237
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:09,419
In you go. Sit down.

238
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:11,659
Put your seat belt on.

239
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:18,458
Okay.

240
00:19:19,778 --> 00:19:22,218
Please note that Einstein's clock...

241
00:19:22,418 --> 00:19:25,138
...is in precise synchronization
with my control watch.

242
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:27,378
Got it?
- Right. Check, Doc.

243
00:19:29,937 --> 00:19:32,777
Have a good trip, Einstein.
Watch your head.

244
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:40,656
You got that thing hooked up to the car?

245
00:19:40,856 --> 00:19:42,696
Watch this.
- Yeah. Okay.

246
00:19:42,856 --> 00:19:44,136
Got it.

247
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:48,896
Jesus!

248
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:55,175
Not me! The car!

249
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:14,213
If my calculations are correct...

250
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,053
...when this baby hits 88 miles per hour...

251
00:20:17,573 --> 00:20:19,773
...you're going to see some serious shit.

252
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:55,649
Watch this!

253
00:21:13,048 --> 00:21:15,207
What did I tell you?

254
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,567
88 miles per hour!

255
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:26,206
The temporal displacement occurred
exactly 1:20 a. m. and zero seconds!

256
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,766
Jesus Christ!

257
00:21:29,926 --> 00:21:32,206
Jesus Christ, Doc!
You disintegrated Einstein!

258
00:21:32,366 --> 00:21:34,726
Calm down. I didn't disintegrate anything.

259
00:21:34,965 --> 00:21:38,845
The molecular structure of both Einstein
and the car are completely intact.

260
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:40,845
Then where the hell are they?

261
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:43,845
The appropriate question is,
When the hell are they?

262
00:21:44,045 --> 00:21:48,124
Einstein has just become
the world's first time traveler.

263
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:51,204
I sent him into the future.

264
00:21:52,324 --> 00:21:54,524
One minute into the future, to be exact.

265
00:21:54,684 --> 00:21:57,643
At precisely 1:21 a. m. and zero seconds...

266
00:21:57,843 --> 00:22:00,603
...we shall catch up with him
and the time machine.

267
00:22:04,003 --> 00:22:05,843
Wait a minute, Doc.

268
00:22:07,522 --> 00:22:10,282
Are you telling me that
you built a time machine...

269
00:22:11,442 --> 00:22:13,482
- ... out of a DeLorean?
- The way I see it...

270
00:22:13,682 --> 00:22:17,401
...if you're going to build a time machine
into a car, why not do it with style?

271
00:22:17,641 --> 00:22:20,681
Besides, the stainless-steel construction
made the flux dispersal-

272
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:23,281
Look out!

273
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:09,077
What? Is it hot?
- It's cold. Damn cold.

274
00:23:12,756 --> 00:23:14,796
Einstein, you little devil!

275
00:23:17,036 --> 00:23:20,555
Einstein's clock is exactly one minute
behind mine and still ticking!

276
00:23:24,075 --> 00:23:25,555
He's okay.
- He's fine.

277
00:23:25,715 --> 00:23:27,795
He's completely unaware
that anything happened.

278
00:23:27,955 --> 00:23:30,435
As far as he's concerned,
the trip was instantaneous.

279
00:23:30,635 --> 00:23:33,034
That's why his watch is exactly
one minute behind mine.

280
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:36,674
He skipped over that minute to
instantly arrive at this moment in time.

281
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:39,114
I'll show you how it works.

282
00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:43,473
First, you turn the time circuits on.

283
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:50,953
This tells you where you're going,
this where you are and this where you were.

284
00:23:51,193 --> 00:23:53,472
Input your destination time on this keypad.

285
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,952
Say you want to see the signing
of the Declaration of Independence.

286
00:23:59,072 --> 00:24:00,952
Or witness the birth of Christ.

287
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:06,431
Here's a red-letter date
in the history of science.

288
00:24:06,631 --> 00:24:09,151
November 5, 1955.

289
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:14,230
Yes, of course.

290
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,110
November 5, 1955.

291
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,470
What happened?

292
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,830
That was the day I invented time travel.

293
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,709
I remember it vividly.

294
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:26,709
I was standing on my toilet
hanging a clock.

295
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:29,509
The porcelain was wet.
I slipped, hit my head on the sink.

296
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:31,429
When I came to, I had a revelation.

297
00:24:31,589 --> 00:24:34,988
A vision. A picture in my head.
A picture of this.

298
00:24:35,628 --> 00:24:38,068
This is what makes time travel possible.

299
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,348
The flux capacitor.

300
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:41,788
Flux capacitor?

301
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:46,187
It's taken almost 30 years and my family
fortune to realize the vision of that day.

302
00:24:46,787 --> 00:24:48,827
My God, has it been that long?

303
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:51,907
Things have certainly changed around here.

304
00:24:53,227 --> 00:24:56,746
I remember when this was all farmland
as far as the eye could see.

305
00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:00,586
Old man Peabody owned all of this.

306
00:25:01,906 --> 00:25:05,506
He had this crazy idea
about breeding pine trees.

307
00:25:09,305 --> 00:25:12,465
This is...
This is heavy-duty, Doc. This is great.

308
00:25:13,065 --> 00:25:15,425
Does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?

309
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:19,144
Unfortunately, no. It requires something
with a little more kick. Plutonium.

310
00:25:19,344 --> 00:25:21,424
Plutonium. Wait a minute.

311
00:25:21,624 --> 00:25:24,144
Are you telling me
that this sucker is nuclear?

312
00:25:24,464 --> 00:25:25,744
Keep rolling there.

313
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:27,583
No, this sucker's electrical...

314
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:31,623
...but I need a nuclear reaction to generate
the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.

315
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:34,863
You don't just walk into a store
and buy plutonium.

316
00:25:35,423 --> 00:25:37,263
Did you rip that off?

317
00:25:39,062 --> 00:25:42,662
Of course. From a group of Libyans.
They wanted me to build them a bomb.

318
00:25:42,902 --> 00:25:46,982
I took the plutonium and gave them a
bomb casing full of pinball machine parts.

319
00:25:47,222 --> 00:25:49,901
Come on. Let's get you a radiation suit.
- Jesus!

320
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:20,738
It's safe now. Everything's lead-lined.

321
00:26:22,578 --> 00:26:24,378
Don't lose those tapes now.

322
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:26,338
I need that as a record.

323
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:28,618
Let's put this back here. There we go.

324
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,657
Almost forgot my luggage.

325
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:35,377
Who knows if they got
cotton underwear in the future.

326
00:26:35,577 --> 00:26:38,337
- I'm allergic to all synthetics.
- The future.

327
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,377
- That's where you're going.
- Right.

328
00:26:40,537 --> 00:26:44,576
25 years. I've always dreamed of seeing
the future, looking beyond my years...

329
00:26:44,816 --> 00:26:46,776
...seeing the progress of mankind.

330
00:26:46,976 --> 00:26:48,016
Why not?

331
00:26:48,176 --> 00:26:51,336
I'll also be able to see
who wins the next 25 World Series.

332
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:53,095
Doc.

333
00:26:54,495 --> 00:26:56,695
Look me up when you get there.

334
00:26:57,495 --> 00:26:59,815
Indeed I will. Roll 'em.

335
00:27:06,014 --> 00:27:08,614
I, Dr. Emmett Brown...

336
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,334
...am about to embark
on an historic journey.

337
00:27:14,493 --> 00:27:16,213
What am I thinking of?

338
00:27:16,373 --> 00:27:18,373
I almost forgot to bring extra plutonium.

339
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:20,893
How do I expect to get back?
One pellet, one trip.

340
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:22,933
I must be out of my mind.

341
00:27:25,452 --> 00:27:26,972
What is it?

342
00:27:35,171 --> 00:27:36,211
My God.

343
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:39,331
They found me.
I don't know how, but they found me.

344
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,531
Run for it, Marty!
- Who?

345
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:44,130
Who do you think? The Libyans!

346
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,970
Holy shit!

347
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,370
I'll draw their fire!

348
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:03,529
Doc, wait!

349
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:18,447
No!

350
00:28:19,327 --> 00:28:21,007
Bastards!

351
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:40,165
Go!

352
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:47,285
Go!

353
00:29:26,121 --> 00:29:28,241
Come on! Move! Goddamn it!

354
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,080
Jesus!

355
00:29:50,479 --> 00:29:51,798
Holy shit!

356
00:29:52,598 --> 00:29:55,198
Let's see if you bastards can do 90.

357
00:30:44,873 --> 00:30:46,153
Pa, what is it?

358
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:47,673
What is it, Pa?

359
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:50,833
Looks like an airplane without wings.

360
00:30:51,513 --> 00:30:54,392
That ain't no airplane. Look.

361
00:31:14,431 --> 00:31:15,670
Don't look!

362
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,350
Listen-

363
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:30,229
Hello.

364
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:34,509
Excuse me.

365
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:39,428
Sorry about your barn.

366
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:45,708
It's already mutated into human form!
Shoot it!

367
00:31:47,707 --> 00:31:49,867
Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!

368
00:31:54,187 --> 00:31:55,467
Wait!

369
00:31:57,706 --> 00:31:59,186
Shoot it, Pa!

370
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:04,346
- My pine! Why you...

371
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:09,585
You space bastard! You killed my pine!

372
00:32:13,905 --> 00:32:15,625
Okay, McFly.

373
00:32:15,785 --> 00:32:17,825
Get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream.

374
00:32:17,985 --> 00:32:20,584
Just a very intense dream.

375
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,900
Listen, you got to help me.
- Don't stop, Wilbur!

376
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,820
It can't be.

377
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:16,219
This is nuts.

378
00:33:20,219 --> 00:33:21,659
Come on.

379
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,858
Perfect.

380
00:35:13,968 --> 00:35:17,568
Remember,
fellow citizens, the future is in your hands.

381
00:35:17,808 --> 00:35:21,207
If you believe in progress,
re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.

382
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:23,447
Progress is his middle name.

383
00:35:23,647 --> 00:35:26,007
Mayor Red Thomas' progress platform...

384
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,487
...means more jobs, better education...

385
00:35:28,646 --> 00:35:31,486
...bigger civic improvements
and lower taxes.

386
00:35:31,686 --> 00:35:35,086
On election day,
cast your vote for a proven leader.

387
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:37,446
Re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.

388
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:42,565
This has got to be a dream.

389
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:00,883
Hey, kid. You jump ship?

390
00:36:01,843 --> 00:36:04,123
- What?
- What's with the life preserver?

391
00:36:09,283 --> 00:36:10,762
I want to use the phone.

392
00:36:11,482 --> 00:36:12,882
It's in the back.

393
00:36:15,482 --> 00:36:16,722
- Brown.

394
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:20,122
Great. You're alive.

395
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,200
Come on.

396
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,039
Do you know where 1640 Riverside-
Are you going to order something, kid?

397
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,199
Yeah.

398
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:49,039
Give me a Tab.

399
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,639
I can't give you a tab
unless you order something.

400
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,678
Right. Give me a Pepsi Free.

401
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:56,318
You want a Pepsi, pal,
you're going to pay for it.

402
00:36:56,558 --> 00:36:59,398
Just give me something
without any sugar in it, okay?

403
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,398
Something without sugar.

404
00:37:09,037 --> 00:37:10,077
McFly.

405
00:37:12,437 --> 00:37:13,957
What are you doing?

406
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:15,876
Biff.

407
00:37:16,196 --> 00:37:18,516
I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug!

408
00:37:18,676 --> 00:37:22,276
Biff. Guys. How are you doing?
You got my homework finished?

409
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,595
Actually, I figured
since it wasn't due 'til Monday-

410
00:37:25,795 --> 00:37:28,435
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

411
00:37:29,035 --> 00:37:30,755
Think, McFly. Think!

412
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,635
I got to have time to recopy it.

413
00:37:32,795 --> 00:37:36,234
You realize what would happen if I hand in
my homework in your handwriting?

414
00:37:36,474 --> 00:37:38,114
I'll get kicked out of school.

415
00:37:38,234 --> 00:37:40,594
You wouldn't want that to happen,
would you?

416
00:37:42,754 --> 00:37:44,354
- Would you?
- Of course not.

417
00:37:44,514 --> 00:37:46,273
- No.
- I wouldn't want that to happen.

418
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:50,073
- What are you looking at, butthead?
- Get a load of his life preserver.

419
00:37:50,313 --> 00:37:51,913
Dork thinks he's going to drown.

420
00:37:52,073 --> 00:37:53,793
How about my homework, McFly?

421
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:56,472
Okay, Biff.

422
00:37:56,632 --> 00:38:00,952
I'll finish that up tonight and then I'll
bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.

423
00:38:01,392 --> 00:38:04,632
Not too early. I sleep in Sundays.
Your shoe's untied!

424
00:38:05,352 --> 00:38:07,231
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

425
00:38:07,391 --> 00:38:10,831
- I don't want to see you in here again.
- Okay. All right. Bye-bye.

426
00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:34,389
- What?
- You're George McFly!

427
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:36,629
Yeah. Who are you?

428
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:39,228
Why do you let those boys
push you around like that for?

429
00:38:39,388 --> 00:38:40,668
They're bigger than me.

430
00:38:40,828 --> 00:38:42,948
Stand tall. Have some respect for yourself.

431
00:38:43,148 --> 00:38:47,348
If you let people walk over you now,
they'll walk over you the rest of your life.

432
00:38:47,628 --> 00:38:50,507
Look at me. You think
I'll spend my life in this slop house?

433
00:38:50,707 --> 00:38:52,387
Watch it, Goldie.
- No, sir!

434
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:54,827
I'll do something.
I'll go to night school.

435
00:38:54,987 --> 00:38:57,027
One day, I'm going to be somebody.

436
00:38:57,187 --> 00:38:58,907
That's right. He's going to be mayor.

437
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:00,346
Yeah, I'm-

438
00:39:01,026 --> 00:39:02,306
Mayor!

439
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:06,706
Now that's a good idea!
I could run for mayor.

440
00:39:06,906 --> 00:39:10,385
- A colored mayor. That'll be the day.
- Wait and see. I will be mayor.

441
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:12,825
I'll be the most powerful man
in Hill Valley...

442
00:39:13,025 --> 00:39:14,705
...and I'm going to clean up this town.

443
00:39:14,865 --> 00:39:17,265
Good. You can start by sweeping the floor.

444
00:39:20,105 --> 00:39:22,064
Mayor Goldie Wilson.

445
00:39:22,224 --> 00:39:23,984
I like the sound of that.

446
00:39:36,063 --> 00:39:39,223
Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!

447
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,260
He's a peeping Tom!

448
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:17,939
Dad!

449
00:40:30,098 --> 00:40:32,098
Wait a minute. Who are you?

450
00:40:33,938 --> 00:40:37,897
Stella! Another one of these damn kids
jumped in front of my car!

451
00:40:39,017 --> 00:40:41,457
Come out hereI
Help me take him in the house!

452
00:40:46,896 --> 00:40:48,216
Mom?

453
00:40:48,456 --> 00:40:49,856
That you?

454
00:40:50,256 --> 00:40:51,616
There, there, now.

455
00:40:51,896 --> 00:40:53,216
Just relax.

456
00:40:55,695 --> 00:40:58,135
You've been asleep
for almost nine hours now.

457
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,615
I had a horrible nightmare.

458
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:06,574
I dreamed that I went back in time.

459
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:08,334
It was terrible.

460
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,334
Well...

461
00:41:10,814 --> 00:41:14,014
...you're safe and sound now
back in good old 1955.

462
00:41:15,294 --> 00:41:16,614
1955?

463
00:41:21,253 --> 00:41:23,693
You're my...

464
00:41:24,013 --> 00:41:25,733
- My name is Lorraine.

465
00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:28,732
Lorraine Baines?
- Yeah.

466
00:41:29,852 --> 00:41:31,292
But you're...

467
00:41:31,452 --> 00:41:32,812
You're so...

468
00:41:32,932 --> 00:41:36,012
You're so thin!

469
00:41:36,252 --> 00:41:39,131
Just relax, Calvin.
You got a big bruise on your head.

470
00:41:43,491 --> 00:41:45,051
Where are my pants?

471
00:41:45,371 --> 00:41:46,731
Over there...

472
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:48,810
...on my hope chest.

473
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,850
I've never seen
purple underwear before, Calvin.

474
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:56,050
Calvin?
Why do you keep calling me Calvin?

475
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,810
That is your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein.

476
00:41:59,409 --> 00:42:01,569
It's written all over your underwear.

477
00:42:02,529 --> 00:42:04,729
I guess they call you Cal, huh?

478
00:42:05,169 --> 00:42:06,849
No, actually, people...

479
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:09,009
...call me Marty.

480
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,528
Pleased to meet you, Calvin-

481
00:42:13,928 --> 00:42:15,208
Marty...

482
00:42:16,608 --> 00:42:17,728
...Klein.

483
00:42:24,287 --> 00:42:27,287
- Do you mind if I sit here?
- No. Fine.

484
00:42:27,567 --> 00:42:29,927
No. Good. Fine. Good.

485
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:34,166
That's a big bruise you have there.

486
00:42:35,526 --> 00:42:37,686
- Lorraine, are you up there?

487
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,606
Oh, my God! It's my mother!

488
00:42:39,806 --> 00:42:42,565
Quick! Put your pants back on!

489
00:42:50,605 --> 00:42:52,724
Marty, how long have you been in port?

490
00:42:52,924 --> 00:42:55,204
Excuse me?
- I guessed you're a sailor.

491
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,604
That's why you wear that life preserver.

492
00:42:57,844 --> 00:42:59,124
Coast guard.

493
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:03,283
Sam, here's the young man you hit
with your car. He's all right. Thank God.

494
00:43:03,563 --> 00:43:05,643
What were you doing
in the middle of the street?

495
00:43:05,803 --> 00:43:08,283
Don't pay attention to him.
He's in one of his moods.

496
00:43:08,523 --> 00:43:11,123
Quit fiddling with that thing.
Come in here to dinner.

497
00:43:11,283 --> 00:43:13,042
You already know Lorraine.

498
00:43:13,202 --> 00:43:15,082
This is Milton, this is Sally...

499
00:43:15,282 --> 00:43:19,122
...that's Toby, and over there
in the playpen is little baby Joey.

500
00:43:21,202 --> 00:43:23,042
So, you're my uncle Joey.

501
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,201
Better get used to these bars, kid.

502
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:30,241
Yes. Joey just loves being in his playpen.

503
00:43:30,521 --> 00:43:33,841
He cries whenever we take him out,
so we leave him in there all the time.

504
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,320
Well, Marty, I hope you like meat loaf.

505
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,360
- Well, listen, I really ought to-
- Sit here, Marty.

506
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,280
Sam, stop fiddling with that thing
and come in here and eat your dinner.

507
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,759
Look at it roll.

508
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:50,719
Now we can watch
Jackie Gleason while we eat.

509
00:43:58,558 --> 00:44:01,798
Our first television set.
Dad just picked it up today.

510
00:44:02,678 --> 00:44:04,238
Do you have a television?

511
00:44:04,758 --> 00:44:07,397
Well, yeah.
You know, we have two of them.

512
00:44:07,637 --> 00:44:10,157
Wow! You must be rich.

513
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:14,517
Honey, he's teasing you.
Nobody has two television sets.

514
00:44:20,076 --> 00:44:22,756
I've seen this one. This is a classic.

515
00:44:22,956 --> 00:44:25,716
This is where Ralph dresses up
as a man from space.

516
00:44:26,076 --> 00:44:29,035
What do you mean, you've seen this?
It's brand-new.

517
00:44:29,475 --> 00:44:31,875
Yeah, well, I saw it on a rerun.

518
00:44:32,435 --> 00:44:33,915
What's a rerun?

519
00:44:34,275 --> 00:44:35,635
You'll find out.

520
00:44:35,755 --> 00:44:37,914
You know, Marty,
you look so familiar to me.

521
00:44:38,114 --> 00:44:39,914
Do I know your mother?

522
00:44:41,154 --> 00:44:42,954
Yeah, I think maybe you do.

523
00:44:43,194 --> 00:44:46,234
Then I'll call her.
I don't want her to worry about you.

524
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:47,554
You can't.

525
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:51,713
That is, nobody's home.

526
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,553
Yet.

527
00:44:57,673 --> 00:44:58,752
Listen.

528
00:44:58,872 --> 00:45:01,272
Do you know where Riverside Drive is?

529
00:45:01,472 --> 00:45:05,112
It's on the other end of town.
A block past Maple. East end of town.

530
00:45:05,512 --> 00:45:08,552
A block past Maple.
That's John F. Kennedy Drive.

531
00:45:10,151 --> 00:45:11,991
Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

532
00:45:12,151 --> 00:45:13,471
Mother?

533
00:45:13,951 --> 00:45:16,351
With Marty's parents out of town...

534
00:45:17,031 --> 00:45:19,231
...don't you think
he ought to spend the night?

535
00:45:19,391 --> 00:45:21,630
After all,
Dad almost killed him with the car.

536
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:23,670
That's true, Marty.

537
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:27,310
I think you should spend the night.
I think you're our responsibility.

538
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:30,709
- Well, gee, I don't know.
- He can sleep in my room.

539
00:45:31,109 --> 00:45:32,629
I got to go!

540
00:45:32,989 --> 00:45:34,989
Thanks very much. You were all great.

541
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,509
See you all later.

542
00:45:37,709 --> 00:45:39,069
Much later.

543
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:45,348
He's a very strange young man.

544
00:45:45,628 --> 00:45:46,868
He's an idiot.

545
00:45:47,068 --> 00:45:50,188
Comes from upbringing.
His parents are probably idiots, too.

546
00:45:51,028 --> 00:45:54,387
Lorraine, you ever have a kid
who acts that way, I'll disown you.

547
00:46:30,984 --> 00:46:32,304
Doc?

548
00:46:32,904 --> 00:46:34,343
Don't say a word.

549
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:37,943
No names. I want
to know nothing about you.

550
00:46:38,143 --> 00:46:39,583
Listen, Doc-
- Quiet!

551
00:46:39,743 --> 00:46:41,263
Don't tell me anything.

552
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:43,343
You got to help-
- Quiet.

553
00:46:45,982 --> 00:46:47,782
I'm going to read your thoughts.

554
00:46:47,982 --> 00:46:51,262
Let's see now.
You come here from a great distance?

555
00:46:51,502 --> 00:46:53,782
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Don't tell me!

556
00:46:54,382 --> 00:46:56,981
You want me to subscribe
to the "Saturday Evening Post".

557
00:46:57,141 --> 00:46:59,541
- No.
- Not a word now!

558
00:46:59,741 --> 00:47:00,781
Quiet.

559
00:47:02,901 --> 00:47:04,141
Donations.

560
00:47:04,301 --> 00:47:06,180
You want me to make a donation...

561
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,540
...to the Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary.

562
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,460
Doc...

563
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,940
...I'm from the future.

564
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,859
I came here in a time machine
that you invented.

565
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:21,819
Now, I need your help
to get back to the year 1985.

566
00:47:23,379 --> 00:47:24,619
My God!

567
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,138
Do you know what this means?

568
00:47:32,858 --> 00:47:36,817
It means that
this damn thing doesn't work at all!

569
00:47:37,057 --> 00:47:41,057
- You got to help me. You are the only
one who knows how your time machine works.

570
00:47:41,337 --> 00:47:42,697
Time machine?

571
00:47:43,257 --> 00:47:45,297
I haven't invented any time machine.

572
00:47:46,817 --> 00:47:48,656
Okay. I'll prove it to you.

573
00:47:49,216 --> 00:47:52,176
Look at my driver's license. Expires 1987.

574
00:47:52,376 --> 00:47:55,656
Look at my birthday.
I haven't even been born yet.

575
00:47:55,896 --> 00:47:57,776
And look at this picture.

576
00:47:58,055 --> 00:48:00,055
It's my brother, my sister and me.

577
00:48:00,215 --> 00:48:03,215
Look at her sweatshirt, Doc.
"Class of 1984"?

578
00:48:04,255 --> 00:48:07,975
Pretty mediocre photographic fakery.
They cut off your brother's hair.

579
00:48:08,974 --> 00:48:11,134
I'm telling the truth.
You got to believe me.

580
00:48:11,334 --> 00:48:13,974
Then tell me, future boy...

581
00:48:14,454 --> 00:48:18,214
...who's president of the United States
in 1985?

582
00:48:18,454 --> 00:48:21,693
- Ronald Reagan.
- Ronald Reagan? The actor?

583
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,653
Then who's vice president? Jerry Lewis?

584
00:48:26,893 --> 00:48:30,132
I suppose Jane Wyman is the First Lady.
- Wait, Doc!

585
00:48:30,332 --> 00:48:32,372
And Jack Benny is treasury secretary.

586
00:48:32,532 --> 00:48:33,732
- Listen to me.

587
00:48:33,932 --> 00:48:37,092
I've had enough jokes for one evening.
Good night, future boy!

588
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:38,492
- No, wait, Doc.

589
00:48:38,652 --> 00:48:42,651
The bruise on your head.
I know how that happened. You told me.

590
00:48:42,891 --> 00:48:45,251
You were standing on your toilet
hanging a clock...

591
00:48:45,451 --> 00:48:47,491
...and you fell
and hit your head on the sink.

592
00:48:47,651 --> 00:48:51,090
That's when you got the idea
for the flux capacitor which...

593
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:54,290
...is what makes time travel possible.

594
00:49:06,929 --> 00:49:10,769
There's something wrong with
the starter, so I hid it here.

595
00:49:21,008 --> 00:49:22,807
After I fell off my toilet...

596
00:49:23,887 --> 00:49:25,167
...I drew this.

597
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,367
The flux capacitor.

598
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:49,205
It works!

599
00:49:51,565 --> 00:49:52,965
It works!

600
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:56,444
I finally invent something that works!

601
00:49:57,604 --> 00:49:59,364
You bet your ass it works.

602
00:50:00,644 --> 00:50:03,084
We've got to sneak this back
to my laboratory.

603
00:50:03,524 --> 00:50:05,243
We've got to get you home!

604
00:50:05,963 --> 00:50:07,323
This is it.

605
00:50:09,443 --> 00:50:11,323
Never mind that now.

606
00:50:11,483 --> 00:50:13,723
Why, that's me! Look at me!

607
00:50:14,003 --> 00:50:15,962
- I'm an old man!
- I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

608
00:50:16,122 --> 00:50:18,002
I'm in the Twin Pines Mall parking lot.

609
00:50:18,162 --> 00:50:20,042
Thank God, I've still got my hair.

610
00:50:20,202 --> 00:50:22,042
What's this thing I'm wearing?

611
00:50:22,202 --> 00:50:24,202
This is a radiation suit.

612
00:50:24,362 --> 00:50:25,961
Radiation suit?

613
00:50:26,121 --> 00:50:29,201
Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout
from the atomic wars.

614
00:50:30,281 --> 00:50:33,041
This is truly amazing.

615
00:50:33,361 --> 00:50:35,721
A portable television studio.

616
00:50:36,081 --> 00:50:39,600
No wonder your president has to be
an actor. He has to look good on TV.

617
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,600
- This is the part coming up.

618
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,839
This sucker's electrical but I need a nuclear
reaction to generate the 1.21 jigowatts...

619
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,919
What did I just say?

620
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:55,079
...this sucker's electrical,
but I need a nuclear reaction...

621
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:58,918
- ... to generate the 1.21 jigowatts of...
-1.21 jigowatts!

622
00:51:00,398 --> 00:51:02,358
1.21 jigowatts.

623
00:51:04,518 --> 00:51:05,958
Great Scott!

624
00:51:08,117 --> 00:51:10,477
What the hell is a jigowatts?

625
00:51:11,197 --> 00:51:13,157
How could I have been so careless?

626
00:51:13,357 --> 00:51:15,077
1.21 jigowatts!

627
00:51:15,237 --> 00:51:17,677
Tom, how am I going to generate
that kind of power?

628
00:51:17,837 --> 00:51:19,276
It can't be done, can it?

629
00:51:19,436 --> 00:51:22,596
Doc, look.
All we need is a little plutonium.

630
00:51:23,316 --> 00:51:27,036
I'm sure that in 1985 plutonium is
available in every corner drugstore...

631
00:51:27,276 --> 00:51:29,795
...but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.

632
00:51:29,995 --> 00:51:32,755
Marty, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

633
00:51:34,435 --> 00:51:36,355
Doc, stuck here? I can't be stuck here.

634
00:51:36,515 --> 00:51:38,595
I got a life in 1985.

635
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:40,714
- I got a girl.
- Is she pretty?

636
00:51:41,354 --> 00:51:42,834
Doc, she's beautiful.

637
00:51:43,754 --> 00:51:45,754
She's crazy about me. Look at this.

638
00:51:46,114 --> 00:51:47,874
Look what she wrote here.

639
00:51:48,194 --> 00:51:49,794
That says it all.

640
00:51:50,633 --> 00:51:53,073
Doc, you're my only hope.

641
00:51:53,713 --> 00:51:56,793
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source
capable of generating...

642
00:51:56,993 --> 00:51:59,953
...1.21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

643
00:52:01,472 --> 00:52:03,592
What did you say?
- A bolt of lightning.

644
00:52:03,752 --> 00:52:07,232
Unfortunately, you never know
when or where it's ever going to strike.

645
00:52:09,312 --> 00:52:10,352
We do now.

646
00:52:15,471 --> 00:52:16,551
This is it!

647
00:52:17,311 --> 00:52:19,351
This is the answer.

648
00:52:19,671 --> 00:52:21,870
It says here that a bolt of lightning...

649
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:25,990
...is going to strike the clock tower
at 10:04 p. m. next Saturday night!

650
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:32,789
If we could somehow harness
this lightning...

651
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:37,149
...channel it into the flux capacitor...

652
00:52:38,509 --> 00:52:39,869
...it just might work.

653
00:52:40,509 --> 00:52:44,308
Next Saturday night
we're sending you back to the future!

654
00:52:45,388 --> 00:52:47,108
All right. Saturday's good.

655
00:52:47,268 --> 00:52:50,788
I can spend a week in 1955.
I can hang out. You can show me around.

656
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:53,867
That is out of the question.
You must not leave this house.

657
00:52:54,067 --> 00:52:55,907
You must not see or talk to anybody.

658
00:52:56,067 --> 00:53:00,027
Anything you do can have repercussions
on future events. Do you understand?

659
00:53:01,147 --> 00:53:02,907
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

660
00:53:03,627 --> 00:53:04,946
Marty...

661
00:53:05,226 --> 00:53:08,106
...have you interacted with anybody else
today besides me?

662
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:13,106
Yeah, well, I might've sort of
bumped into my parents.

663
00:53:13,306 --> 00:53:16,545
Great Scott! Let me see that photograph
again of your brother.

664
00:53:20,305 --> 00:53:23,625
Just as I thought. This proves my theory.
Look at your brother.

665
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,744
His head's gone. It's like it's been erased.

666
00:53:29,464 --> 00:53:31,344
Erased from existence.

667
00:53:36,863 --> 00:53:39,343
They really cleaned this place up.
Looks brand-new.

668
00:53:39,543 --> 00:53:42,743
According to my theory, you interfered
with your parents' first meeting.

669
00:53:42,943 --> 00:53:45,943
If they don't meet, they won't fall in love,
get married or have kids.

670
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:48,342
That's why your brother's disappearing.

671
00:53:48,502 --> 00:53:51,742
Your sister will follow, and unless
you repair the damage, you're next.

672
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:54,702
Sounds heavy.
- Weight has nothing to do with it.

673
00:53:54,902 --> 00:53:56,302
Which one's your pop?

674
00:53:57,821 --> 00:53:58,861
That's him.

675
00:53:59,501 --> 00:54:01,541
Okay. Okay, you guys.

676
00:54:03,421 --> 00:54:06,381
Very funny.
You guys are being real mature.

677
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:08,340
Maybe you were adopted.

678
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:10,780
Okay, real mature, guys.

679
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,140
Okay, pick up my books.
- McFly.

680
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,620
That's Strickland.

681
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,299
Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

682
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:20,819
Shape up, man. You're a slacker.

683
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:23,979
Do you want to be a slacker
for the rest of your life?

684
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,059
No.

685
00:54:25,539 --> 00:54:28,139
- What did your mother see in him?
- I don't know.

686
00:54:28,418 --> 00:54:31,898
I guess she felt sorry for him
'cause her dad hit him with the car.

687
00:54:32,658 --> 00:54:34,698
He hit me with the car.

688
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,738
That's the Florence Nightingale effect.

689
00:54:36,938 --> 00:54:40,177
It happens in hospitals when
nurses fall in love with their patients.

690
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:41,537
Go to it, kid.

691
00:54:43,017 --> 00:54:45,017
George, buddy.

692
00:54:45,497 --> 00:54:47,622
I have been looking all over for you.

693
00:54:47,657 --> 00:54:50,776
You remember me,
the guy who saved your life the other day?

694
00:54:51,696 --> 00:54:54,536
- Yeah.
- There's somebody I'd like you to meet.

695
00:54:58,936 --> 00:54:59,975
Lorraine?

696
00:55:00,815 --> 00:55:01,935
Calvin!

697
00:55:02,975 --> 00:55:05,535
I'd like you to meet
my good friend George McFly.

698
00:55:05,695 --> 00:55:08,695
Hi. It's really a pleasure to meet you.

699
00:55:09,975 --> 00:55:12,334
- How's your head?
- Good. Fine.

700
00:55:12,774 --> 00:55:15,934
I've been worried about you
ever since you ran off the other night.

701
00:55:16,134 --> 00:55:17,374
Are you okay?

702
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:21,054
- I'm sorry. I have to go.
- Come on!

703
00:55:22,013 --> 00:55:23,653
Isn't he a dreamboat?

704
00:55:27,733 --> 00:55:30,773
- She didn't even look at him.
- This is more serious than I thought.

705
00:55:30,973 --> 00:55:33,852
Your mother is infatuated with you
instead of your father.

706
00:55:35,012 --> 00:55:36,052
Wait a minute, Doc.

707
00:55:36,212 --> 00:55:39,572
Are you trying to tell me
that my mother has got the hots for me?

708
00:55:39,772 --> 00:55:42,172
- Precisely.
- This is heavy.

709
00:55:42,491 --> 00:55:44,411
There's that word again. "Heavy".

710
00:55:44,571 --> 00:55:48,451
Why are things so heavy in the future?
Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pole?

711
00:55:48,691 --> 00:55:51,731
The only way we're going to
get them to mate is if they're alone.

712
00:55:51,971 --> 00:55:54,210
You've got to get them to interact...

713
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:56,450
...in some sort of social...

714
00:55:57,850 --> 00:55:59,970
- You mean like a date?
- Right!

715
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:03,130
What kind of date?
What do kids do in the '50s?

716
00:56:03,809 --> 00:56:05,809
They're your parents.
You must know them.

717
00:56:05,969 --> 00:56:09,409
What are their common interests?
What do they like to do together?

718
00:56:09,929 --> 00:56:10,929
Nothing.

719
00:56:11,049 --> 00:56:13,888
Look! There's a rhythmic
ceremonial ritual coming up.

720
00:56:14,248 --> 00:56:17,368
The Enchantment Under the Sea dance!
They're supposed to go to this.

721
00:56:17,568 --> 00:56:20,368
- That's where they kiss for the first time.
- All right, kid.

722
00:56:20,568 --> 00:56:24,008
You stick to your father like glue
and make sure he takes her to that dance.

723
00:56:24,527 --> 00:56:26,247
George, buddy...

724
00:56:26,727 --> 00:56:29,687
...remember that girl
I introduced you to, Lorraine?

725
00:56:35,646 --> 00:56:37,206
What are you writing?

726
00:56:38,406 --> 00:56:39,526
Stories.

727
00:56:40,046 --> 00:56:43,446
Science fiction stories
about visitors...

728
00:56:43,886 --> 00:56:46,845
...coming down to Earth
from other planets.

729
00:56:48,925 --> 00:56:52,285
Get out of town!
I didn't know you did anything creative.

730
00:56:52,925 --> 00:56:55,485
- Let me read some.
- No, no.

731
00:56:55,685 --> 00:56:58,364
I never let anybody read my stories.

732
00:56:59,164 --> 00:57:00,404
- Why not?

733
00:57:01,564 --> 00:57:05,004
What if they didn't like them?
What if they told me I was no good?

734
00:57:07,003 --> 00:57:10,243
I guess that would be pretty hard
for somebody to understand.

735
00:57:11,043 --> 00:57:13,403
No. No, not hard at all.

736
00:57:14,683 --> 00:57:17,043
So anyway, George. About Lorraine.

737
00:57:18,242 --> 00:57:19,682
She really likes you.

738
00:57:20,922 --> 00:57:23,442
She told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her...

739
00:57:23,642 --> 00:57:25,442
...to the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.

740
00:57:25,602 --> 00:57:26,522
- Really?
- Yeah.

741
00:57:26,802 --> 00:57:29,401
All you got to do is go over there
and ask her.

742
00:57:30,641 --> 00:57:32,681
Right here, right now, in the cafeteria?

743
00:57:32,841 --> 00:57:36,201
What if she said no? I don't know
if I could take that kind of rejection.

744
00:57:38,001 --> 00:57:41,640
Besides, I think she'd rather go
with somebody else.

745
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,080
- Who?

746
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:46,920
Biff.

747
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,719
- Don't kid around. Come on.
- Come on. Leave.

748
00:57:50,919 --> 00:57:52,719
You know you want it.

749
00:57:52,879 --> 00:57:54,719
You know you want me to give it to you.

750
00:57:54,879 --> 00:57:57,559
Shut your filthy mouth.
I'm not that kind of girl.

751
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,998
Maybe you are
and you just don't know it yet.

752
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:02,958
Get your meat hooks off of me.

753
00:58:03,118 --> 00:58:05,798
You heard her.
She said, get your meat hooks...

754
00:58:06,598 --> 00:58:07,518
...off.

755
00:58:08,838 --> 00:58:09,918
Please.

756
00:58:10,797 --> 00:58:12,477
What's it to you, butthead?

757
00:58:13,877 --> 00:58:15,797
You been looking for a fight.

758
00:58:25,556 --> 00:58:28,436
Since you're new here,
I'm going to cut you a break...

759
00:58:28,996 --> 00:58:29,996
...today.

760
00:58:31,195 --> 00:58:33,475
So why don't you make like a tree...

761
00:58:33,755 --> 00:58:35,235
...and get out of here.

762
00:58:46,954 --> 00:58:47,514
- George!

763
00:58:49,514 --> 00:58:51,314
Why do you keep following me?

764
00:58:51,474 --> 00:58:55,913
George, I'm telling you,
if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance...

765
00:58:56,153 --> 00:58:58,913
- ... I'll regret it for the rest of my life.
- I can't go.

766
00:58:59,153 --> 00:59:02,033
I'll miss my favorite TV program,
Science Fiction Theatre.

767
00:59:02,273 --> 00:59:05,352
Yeah, but Lorraine wants to go with you.

768
00:59:05,672 --> 00:59:07,072
Give her a break.

769
00:59:07,472 --> 00:59:10,712
I'm just not ready
to ask Lorraine out to the dance...

770
00:59:11,472 --> 00:59:14,271
...and not you
or anybody else on this planet...

771
00:59:14,631 --> 00:59:16,631
...is going to make me change my mind.

772
00:59:23,631 --> 00:59:25,350
Science Fiction Theatre.

773
00:59:55,907 --> 00:59:56,987
Who are you?

774
01:00:02,187 --> 01:00:04,107
"Silence, Earthling.

775
01:00:05,547 --> 01:00:07,786
My name is Darth Vader.

776
01:00:12,746 --> 01:00:15,946
I am an extraterrestrial
from the planet Vulcan.

777
01:00:18,105 --> 01:00:19,025
Marty!

778
01:00:22,225 --> 01:00:24,225
- Marty! Marty!
- George, buddy.

779
01:00:24,425 --> 01:00:26,665
You weren't at school.
What have you been doing?

780
01:00:26,825 --> 01:00:29,504
I overslept. I need your help.

781
01:00:29,704 --> 01:00:32,464
I have to ask Lorraine out,
but I don't know how to do it.

782
01:00:32,664 --> 01:00:34,904
Keep your pants on. She's over in the cafe.

783
01:00:35,104 --> 01:00:36,984
God! How do you...?

784
01:00:39,783 --> 01:00:41,343
What made you change your mind?

785
01:00:41,503 --> 01:00:44,183
Last night, Darth Vader came down
from planet Vulcan...

786
01:00:44,383 --> 01:00:47,983
...and told me that if I didn't
take Lorraine out, he'd melt my brain.

787
01:00:48,223 --> 01:00:51,062
Let's just keep this brain-melting stuff
to ourselves, okay?

788
01:00:51,262 --> 01:00:54,262
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right. There she is.

789
01:00:54,702 --> 01:00:56,342
Just go in there and invite her.

790
01:00:56,502 --> 01:00:59,021
But I don't know what to say.
Say anything.

791
01:00:59,181 --> 01:01:02,421
Say whatever's natural,
the first thing that comes into your mind.

792
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:05,421
Nothing's coming to my mind.

793
01:01:05,581 --> 01:01:07,581
Jesus. It's a wonder I was even born.

794
01:01:07,741 --> 01:01:10,100
- What? What?
- Nothing.

795
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:14,100
Tell her destiny brought you together.

796
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:17,860
Tell her she is the most beautiful girl
you have ever seen in the world.

797
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,620
Girls like that stuff.

798
01:01:20,299 --> 01:01:23,259
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing this down. This is good stuff.

799
01:01:23,459 --> 01:01:26,299
- Yeah. Okay. Can you take care of that?
- Right.

800
01:01:43,817 --> 01:01:46,337
Lou, give me a milk.

801
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:48,937
Chocolate.

802
01:02:04,735 --> 01:02:05,895
- Lorraine.

803
01:02:06,535 --> 01:02:07,735
My density...

804
01:02:08,455 --> 01:02:10,215
...has popped me to you.

805
01:02:10,975 --> 01:02:12,095
What?

806
01:02:14,134 --> 01:02:16,574
What I meant to say was-

807
01:02:16,814 --> 01:02:19,334
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you from somewhere?

808
01:02:20,134 --> 01:02:21,134
- Yes.

809
01:02:21,494 --> 01:02:25,093
Yes. I'm George. George McFly.

810
01:02:25,853 --> 01:02:27,373
I'm your density.

811
01:02:28,413 --> 01:02:29,573
I mean...

812
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:32,173
...your destiny.

813
01:02:35,572 --> 01:02:36,412
- McFly.

814
01:02:40,852 --> 01:02:43,252
I thought I told you never to come in here.

815
01:02:46,091 --> 01:02:47,731
Well, it's going to cost you.

816
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:50,371
How much money you got on you?

817
01:02:51,011 --> 01:02:52,691
- How much do you want, Biff?

818
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:02,250
All right, punk.

819
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:04,770
- Now I'm going to-
- Biff. What's that?

820
01:03:11,609 --> 01:03:14,449
That's Calvin Klein. My God, he's a dream.

821
01:03:15,409 --> 01:03:17,928
Kid! Kid, stop! Stop!

822
01:03:20,768 --> 01:03:22,328
I'll get it back to you.

823
01:03:22,808 --> 01:03:24,408
You broke it!

824
01:03:24,768 --> 01:03:26,488
Come back here!

825
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:29,807
Look at him go!

826
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:32,327
Get him!

827
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:47,446
- To the car! Go!

828
01:03:53,525 --> 01:03:56,125
What's that thing he's on?
- A board with wheels.

829
01:03:56,325 --> 01:03:57,765
He's an absolute dream.

830
01:03:57,885 --> 01:04:00,484
- Come on, come on!
- Look out for the car!

831
01:04:32,561 --> 01:04:33,921
I'm going to ram him.

832
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,440
Shit!

833
01:05:06,718 --> 01:05:08,038
Thanks a lot, kid.

834
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:11,438
I'm going to get that son of a bitch.

835
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:14,677
- Where does he come from?
- Yeah, where does he live?

836
01:05:15,477 --> 01:05:16,757
I don't know...

837
01:05:17,317 --> 01:05:19,157
...but I'm going to find out.

838
01:05:24,516 --> 01:05:25,476
My God.

839
01:05:26,196 --> 01:05:28,916
They found me.
I don't know how, but they found me.

840
01:05:29,236 --> 01:05:30,676
Run for it, Marty!

841
01:05:35,355 --> 01:05:36,275
My God.

842
01:05:37,435 --> 01:05:40,035
They found me.
I don't know how, but they found me.

843
01:05:40,315 --> 01:05:41,555
Run for it, Marty!

844
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:43,715
Doc?

845
01:05:44,634 --> 01:05:47,354
Hi, Marty. I didn't hear you come in.

846
01:05:48,394 --> 01:05:50,714
Fascinating device, this video unit.

847
01:05:51,794 --> 01:05:53,314
Listen, Doc.

848
01:05:53,474 --> 01:05:57,913
I haven't told you about -
- One shouldn't know about his own destiny.

849
01:05:58,153 --> 01:05:59,593
- You don't understand.
- I do.

850
01:05:59,753 --> 01:06:02,073
If I know too much
I endanger my own existence...

851
01:06:02,273 --> 01:06:04,513
...just as you've endangered yours.

852
01:06:06,552 --> 01:06:08,312
You're right.

853
01:06:08,472 --> 01:06:11,112
Let me show you my plan
for sending you home.

854
01:06:11,312 --> 01:06:13,072
Please excuse the crudity of this model.

855
01:06:13,232 --> 01:06:15,551
I didn't have time to build it to scale
or paint it.

856
01:06:15,751 --> 01:06:17,711
- It's good.
- Thank you.

857
01:06:19,551 --> 01:06:23,471
We run industrial-strength electrical cable
from the top of the clock tower...

858
01:06:23,751 --> 01:06:26,990
...down, suspending it over the street
between these two lampposts.

859
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:31,150
Meanwhile, we've outfitted the time
vehicle with this big pole and hook...

860
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:34,230
...which runs directly
into the flux capacitor.

861
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:36,949
At the calculated moment...

862
01:06:37,589 --> 01:06:39,589
...you start o"ff f"rom down the street...

863
01:06:39,749 --> 01:06:43,469
...driving directly toward the cable,
accelerating to 88 miles per hour.

864
01:06:43,869 --> 01:06:47,188
According to the flyer, at precisely
10:04 p. m. this Saturday night...

865
01:06:47,428 --> 01:06:50,748
...lightning will strike the clock tower,
electrifying the cable...

866
01:06:50,948 --> 01:06:53,028
...as the connecting hook makes contact...

867
01:06:53,228 --> 01:06:56,548
...thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts
into the flux capacitor...

868
01:06:57,068 --> 01:06:58,947
...and sending you back to 1985.

869
01:06:59,227 --> 01:07:02,547
All right, now. Watch this.
You wind up the car and release it.

870
01:07:04,827 --> 01:07:06,627
I'll simulate the lightning.

871
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:15,786
Ready.

872
01:07:25,385 --> 01:07:26,425
Set.

873
01:07:31,304 --> 01:07:32,264
Release.

874
01:07:50,023 --> 01:07:52,222
- You're instilling me
with a lot of confidence.

875
01:07:52,382 --> 01:07:55,742
Don't worry. I'll take care of ideas.
You take care of your pop.

876
01:07:57,062 --> 01:07:58,022
By the way...

877
01:07:58,142 --> 01:08:00,142
...what happened today? Did he ask her out?

878
01:08:00,302 --> 01:08:02,181
- I think so.
- What did she say?

879
01:08:10,581 --> 01:08:14,540
It's your mom! She's tracked you down!
Quick! Let's cover the time machine.

880
01:08:27,459 --> 01:08:29,699
Hi, Cal... Marty.

881
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:31,899
- Lorraine.

882
01:08:33,138 --> 01:08:34,898
How did you know I was here?

883
01:08:36,138 --> 01:08:37,298
I followed you.

884
01:08:39,018 --> 01:08:40,978
This is my doc... My uncle...

885
01:08:41,858 --> 01:08:43,657
...Doc Brown.

886
01:08:44,657 --> 01:08:45,817
- Hi.
- Hi.

887
01:08:48,817 --> 01:08:51,857
Marty, this may seem a little forward...

888
01:08:52,217 --> 01:08:54,296
...but I was kind of wondering...

889
01:08:54,976 --> 01:08:56,976
...if you'd ask me to the...

890
01:08:57,816 --> 01:09:00,576
...Enchantment Under the Sea dance
on Saturday?

891
01:09:02,576 --> 01:09:03,656
You mean...

892
01:09:04,096 --> 01:09:05,855
You mean nobody's asked you?

893
01:09:06,295 --> 01:09:07,175
- No.

894
01:09:08,295 --> 01:09:09,495
Not yet.

895
01:09:10,895 --> 01:09:13,975
- What about George?
- George McFly?

896
01:09:16,614 --> 01:09:20,294
He's kind of cute and all, but not...

897
01:09:21,294 --> 01:09:22,214
Well...

898
01:09:23,094 --> 01:09:25,134
I think a man should be strong...

899
01:09:27,093 --> 01:09:29,133
...so he can stand up for himself...

900
01:09:30,253 --> 01:09:32,453
...and protect the woman he loves.

901
01:09:36,932 --> 01:09:37,932
Don't you?

902
01:09:39,692 --> 01:09:40,492
Yeah.

903
01:09:41,532 --> 01:09:43,252
I still don't understand.

904
01:09:43,532 --> 01:09:46,012
How am I supposed to
go to the dance with her...

905
01:09:46,212 --> 01:09:48,731
...if she's already going
to the dance with you?

906
01:09:48,931 --> 01:09:51,411
Well, because, George,
she wants to go with you.

907
01:09:51,571 --> 01:09:53,291
She just doesn't know it yet.

908
01:09:53,491 --> 01:09:56,251
That's why we got to show her
that you, George, are a fighter.

909
01:09:56,451 --> 01:09:59,650
You're somebody who stands up
for yourself and will protect her.

910
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:02,770
Yeah, but I've never picked a fight
in my entire life.

911
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:05,570
Look, you're not going
to be picking a fight, Dad...

912
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:07,330
Dad-dad-daddy-o.

913
01:10:07,969 --> 01:10:09,969
You're coming to her rescue, right?

914
01:10:10,209 --> 01:10:12,969
Let's go over the plan again.
8:55, where are you going to be?

915
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,689
I'm going to be at the dance.

916
01:10:14,809 --> 01:10:17,649
- And where am I going to be?
- You'll be in the car, with her.

917
01:10:17,889 --> 01:10:20,608
Right around 9:00,
she's going to get very angry with me.

918
01:10:20,808 --> 01:10:23,008
Why is she going to get angry with you?

919
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:27,408
Well, because, George, nice girls get angry
when guys take advantage of them.

920
01:10:29,847 --> 01:10:34,047
- You're going to go touch her on her-
- No. No, George, look.

921
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,807
It's just an act, right?

922
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:40,606
So, 9:00, you're strolling
through the parking lot.

923
01:10:40,926 --> 01:10:44,086
You see us struggling in the car.

924
01:10:44,366 --> 01:10:47,286
You walk up, you open the door,
and you say...

925
01:10:49,006 --> 01:10:50,445
Your line, George.

926
01:10:53,685 --> 01:10:56,285
Hey, you, get your damn hands off her!

927
01:10:58,645 --> 01:11:00,844
- You really think I ought to swear?
- Definitely.

928
01:11:01,004 --> 01:11:02,524
Goddamn it, George, swear.

929
01:11:02,684 --> 01:11:05,364
Okay. So now you come up.
You punch me in the stomach.

930
01:11:05,564 --> 01:11:07,324
I'm out for the count, right?

931
01:11:07,644 --> 01:11:10,484
And you and Lorraine
live happily ever after.

932
01:11:10,764 --> 01:11:12,763
You make it sound so easy.

933
01:11:12,963 --> 01:11:15,523
I just... I wish I wasn't so scared.

934
01:11:15,723 --> 01:11:19,043
There's nothing to be scared of.
All it takes is self-confidence.

935
01:11:19,243 --> 01:11:21,443
You know, if you put your mind to it...

936
01:11:21,882 --> 01:11:23,762
...you can accomplish anything.

937
01:11:25,482 --> 01:11:27,882
Hill Valley weather this Saturday night.

938
01:11:28,042 --> 01:11:30,642
Mostly clear, with some scattered clouds.

939
01:11:30,842 --> 01:11:32,561
Lows tonight, in the upper forties.

940
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:35,161
Are you sure about this storm?

941
01:11:35,361 --> 01:11:39,321
Since when can weathermen predict
the weather, let alone the future?

942
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:42,041
You know, Marty,
I'm going to be very sad to see you go.

943
01:11:42,241 --> 01:11:45,600
You've made a difference in my life,
given me something to shoot for.

944
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,640
Just knowing
that I'm going to be around to see 1985.

945
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,680
That I'm going to succeed in this!

946
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,599
That I'm going to have a chance
to travel through time!

947
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:02,919
It's going to be hard
waiting 30 years to talk to you...

948
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:05,838
...about everything that's happened
in the past few days.

949
01:12:06,038 --> 01:12:08,238
I'm really going to miss you, Marty.

950
01:12:09,798 --> 01:12:11,158
I'm going to miss you.

951
01:12:15,757 --> 01:12:18,437
- Doc, about the future-
- No!

952
01:12:18,637 --> 01:12:23,437
We've agreed that information about
the future can be extremely dangerous.

953
01:12:23,757 --> 01:12:27,396
Even if your intentions are good,
it can backfire drastically.

954
01:12:28,356 --> 01:12:32,396
Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out
through the natural course of time.

955
01:12:33,556 --> 01:12:35,356
"Dear Dr. Brown:

956
01:12:36,155 --> 01:12:38,755
"On the night that I go back in time...

957
01:12:38,955 --> 01:12:41,035
"... you will be...

958
01:12:41,195 --> 01:12:44,235
"... shot by terrorists.

959
01:12:44,435 --> 01:12:48,634
"Please take whatever precautions are
necessary to prevent this terrible disaster.

960
01:12:50,634 --> 01:12:52,194
"Your friend...

961
01:12:53,074 --> 01:12:54,434
"... Marty. "

962
01:13:03,513 --> 01:13:06,193
'Evening, Dr. Brown. What's with the wire?

963
01:13:06,433 --> 01:13:09,112
Just a little weather experiment.

964
01:13:10,672 --> 01:13:12,872
- What you got under here?
- No! Don't touch that!

965
01:13:13,072 --> 01:13:15,632
Some new, specialized
weather-sensing equipment.

966
01:13:15,832 --> 01:13:17,911
Got a permit for that?

967
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,831
Of course I do.

968
01:13:26,391 --> 01:13:29,030
- Just a second.
Let me see if I can find it here.

969
01:14:19,426 --> 01:14:21,465
Do you mind if we...

970
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:23,985
...park for a while?

971
01:14:24,985 --> 01:14:27,785
That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

972
01:14:27,985 --> 01:14:32,344
I'm almost 18 years old.
It's not like I've never parked before.

973
01:14:33,304 --> 01:14:34,664
What?

974
01:14:35,064 --> 01:14:37,784
Marty, you seem so nervous.
Is something wrong?

975
01:14:38,024 --> 01:14:39,064
No.

976
01:14:40,104 --> 01:14:41,144
No.

977
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:47,823
Lorraine, what are you doing?

978
01:14:48,463 --> 01:14:50,623
I swiped it from
the old lady's liquor cabinet.

979
01:14:50,823 --> 01:14:53,382
Yeah, well, you shouldn't drink.

980
01:14:53,702 --> 01:14:55,462
- Why not?
- Because you...

981
01:14:56,222 --> 01:14:59,502
You might regret it later in life.

982
01:14:59,742 --> 01:15:01,662
Marty, don't be such a square.

983
01:15:01,822 --> 01:15:04,341
Everybody who's anybody drinks.

984
01:15:08,781 --> 01:15:10,461
Jeez, you smoke too?

985
01:15:11,861 --> 01:15:14,540
You're beginning to sound
just like my mother.

986
01:15:25,499 --> 01:15:28,779
We're going to take a little break,
but we'll be back in a while...

987
01:15:29,019 --> 01:15:31,459
...so don't nobody go nowhere.

988
01:15:46,697 --> 01:15:49,697
Marty? Why are you so nervous?

989
01:15:51,017 --> 01:15:52,177
Lorraine...

990
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:55,017
...have you ever...

991
01:15:56,096 --> 01:15:59,696
...been in a situation where you knew
you had to act a certain way, but when...

992
01:15:59,896 --> 01:16:02,816
...you got there, you didn't know
if you could go through with it?

993
01:16:03,056 --> 01:16:05,896
You mean like how
you're supposed to act on a first date?

994
01:16:06,455 --> 01:16:07,895
Sort of.

995
01:16:08,055 --> 01:16:11,095
I think I know exactly what you mean.

996
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:12,975
You do?

997
01:16:13,455 --> 01:16:15,895
You know what I do in those situations?

998
01:16:16,095 --> 01:16:18,174
- What?
- I don't worry.

999
01:16:35,373 --> 01:16:37,133
This is all wrong.

1000
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:39,452
I don't know what it is...

1001
01:16:40,612 --> 01:16:44,012
...but when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing...

1002
01:16:45,652 --> 01:16:46,892
...my brother.

1003
01:16:47,252 --> 01:16:49,731
I guess that doesn't make any sense,
does it?

1004
01:16:49,931 --> 01:16:51,451
Believe me...

1005
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:53,891
...it makes perfect sense.

1006
01:16:55,251 --> 01:16:56,131
Somebody's coming.

1007
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:04,650
You caused $300 damage to my car,
you son of a bitch...

1008
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:07,170
...and I'm going to take it out of your ass.

1009
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:08,810
Hold him.

1010
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:11,449
Let him go, Biff. You're drunk.

1011
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:14,209
Well, lookee what we have here.

1012
01:17:17,249 --> 01:17:20,568
No! Stay right here with me.
Come on, Lorraine.

1013
01:17:20,808 --> 01:17:22,808
Let me go!
- Leave her alone!

1014
01:17:23,008 --> 01:17:24,848
Take him in back. I'll be right there.

1015
01:17:25,008 --> 01:17:27,808
Just admit that you want it. Come on.

1016
01:17:28,048 --> 01:17:30,408
Well, go on. This ain't no peep show.

1017
01:17:36,727 --> 01:17:38,887
- Hey, let's put him in there.
- Yeah!

1018
01:17:40,527 --> 01:17:42,686
That's for messing up my hair.

1019
01:17:42,886 --> 01:17:44,806
What the hell are you doing to my car?

1020
01:17:44,966 --> 01:17:47,646
Hey, beat it, spook.
This don't concern you.

1021
01:17:49,806 --> 01:17:52,565
Who you calling spook, peckerwood?

1022
01:17:53,685 --> 01:17:55,125
- Listen, guys...

1023
01:17:55,285 --> 01:17:57,765
...I don't want to mess
with no reefer addicts, okay?

1024
01:17:57,925 --> 01:17:59,605
- Get home to your mama, boy.

1025
01:17:59,765 --> 01:18:01,805
- Biff!
- Hurry, Biff!

1026
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:04,284
- Let me out of here!

1027
01:18:05,884 --> 01:18:07,404
Reginald, where are your keys?

1028
01:18:07,564 --> 01:18:09,564
- The keys are in the trunk.

1029
01:18:09,964 --> 01:18:12,764
- Say that again?
- I said, the keys are in here.

1030
01:18:17,483 --> 01:18:19,003
Let me go!

1031
01:18:26,042 --> 01:18:27,042
- Come on!

1032
01:18:29,242 --> 01:18:32,522
Hey you, get your damn hands off...

1033
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:37,041
I think you got the wrong car, McFly.

1034
01:18:38,761 --> 01:18:40,641
George, help me! Please!

1035
01:18:40,801 --> 01:18:44,121
Just turn around, McFly, and walk away.

1036
01:18:44,561 --> 01:18:46,520
Please, George.
- Are you deaf?

1037
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,600
Close the door and beat it.

1038
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:54,560
No, Biff. You leave her alone.

1039
01:18:55,359 --> 01:18:56,999
All right, McFly.

1040
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:02,039
You're asking for it...

1041
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:04,159
...and now you're going to get it.

1042
01:19:05,399 --> 01:19:06,558
Stop it!

1043
01:19:07,398 --> 01:19:09,158
Biff, you'll break his arm!

1044
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:12,798
- Biff, no!

1045
01:19:13,038 --> 01:19:14,798
- Give me a hand here, Reginald.

1046
01:19:16,517 --> 01:19:18,557
Damn it, man! I sliced my hand!

1047
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:20,117
- Whose are these?
- Mine.

1048
01:19:20,277 --> 01:19:22,037
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

1049
01:19:23,397 --> 01:19:25,517
You're going to break his arm!

1050
01:19:25,837 --> 01:19:28,796
Biff! Biff, leave him alone!

1051
01:19:29,036 --> 01:19:31,316
Let him go! Let him go!

1052
01:20:02,953 --> 01:20:04,713
Are you okay?

1053
01:20:23,831 --> 01:20:25,671
Who is that guy?

1054
01:20:26,031 --> 01:20:27,791
That's George McFly.

1055
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:32,670
That's George McFly?

1056
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:34,150
Excuse me.

1057
01:20:45,029 --> 01:20:46,429
The storm.

1058
01:20:48,389 --> 01:20:50,869
Guys, you got to get back in there
and finish the dance.

1059
01:20:51,069 --> 01:20:52,388
Look at Marvin's hand.

1060
01:20:52,508 --> 01:20:55,508
He can't play with this hand,
and we can't play without him.

1061
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:57,108
Marvin, you got to play.

1062
01:20:57,268 --> 01:21:00,868
They kiss for the first time at the dance.
If there's no music, they can't dance.

1063
01:21:01,108 --> 01:21:04,587
If they can't dance and kiss,
then they can't fall in love and I'm history.

1064
01:21:04,827 --> 01:21:08,427
The dance is over unless you know
somebody that can play the guitar.

1065
01:21:15,546 --> 01:21:17,786
This is for all you lovers out there.

01:24:19,929 --> 01:24:23,608
"Go go
Go Johnny go, go

1105
01:24:24,248 --> 01:24:26,648
"Go Johnny, go, go, go

1106
01:24:27,048 --> 01:24:28,608
"Go Johnny go, go"

1107
01:24:28,728 --> 01:24:30,928
George, I heard you laid out Biff.
Nice going.

1108
01:24:31,128 --> 01:24:33,207
You ever think of
running for class president?

1109
01:24:33,407 --> 01:24:35,607
"Johnny B. Goode

1110
01:24:37,967 --> 01:24:40,127
"Go Johnny go, go

1111
01:24:40,607 --> 01:24:43,087
"Go Johnny go, go, go

1112
01:24:43,207 --> 01:24:45,726
"Go Johnny go, go

1113
01:24:45,926 --> 01:24:48,566
"Go Johnny go, go, go

1114
01:24:49,326 --> 01:24:51,126
"Johnny B. Goode"

1115
01:24:53,566 --> 01:24:56,125
Chuck! Chuck, it's Marvin.

1116
01:24:56,325 --> 01:24:58,685
Your cousin, Marvin Berry?

1117
01:24:58,845 --> 01:25:01,405
You know that new sound
you're looking for?

1118
01:25:01,605 --> 01:25:03,525
Well, listen to this.

1119
01:26:10,078 --> 01:26:12,438
I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet...

1120
01:26:13,998 --> 01:26:15,798
...but your kids are going to love it.

1121
01:26:19,917 --> 01:26:21,037
Lorraine.

1122
01:26:21,277 --> 01:26:23,757
Marty, that was very interesting music.

1123
01:26:24,557 --> 01:26:25,717
Yeah.

1124
01:26:25,837 --> 01:26:29,156
I hope you don't mind, but George
asked if he could take me home.

1125
01:26:29,396 --> 01:26:33,676
Great! Good. Good, Lorraine.
I had a feeling about you two.

1126
01:26:34,236 --> 01:26:35,676
I have a feeling, too.

1127
01:26:36,476 --> 01:26:38,196
Listen, I got to go, but...

1128
01:26:38,396 --> 01:26:42,235
...I wanted to tell you that
it's been educational.

1129
01:26:43,395 --> 01:26:45,435
- Marty, will we ever see you again?

1130
01:26:46,955 --> 01:26:48,035
I guarantee it.

1131
01:26:48,195 --> 01:26:51,274
Well, Marty, I want to thank you
for all your good advice.

1132
01:26:51,514 --> 01:26:53,794
I'll never forget it.

1133
01:26:54,474 --> 01:26:55,914
Right, George.

1134
01:26:57,274 --> 01:27:00,514
Well, good luck, you guys.

1135
01:27:04,473 --> 01:27:06,153
One other thing.

1136
01:27:06,313 --> 01:27:08,153
If you guys ever have kids...

1137
01:27:08,313 --> 01:27:10,513
...and one of them,
when he's eight years old...

1138
01:27:10,713 --> 01:27:13,472
...accidentally sets fire
to the living room rug...

1139
01:27:14,912 --> 01:27:16,352
...go easy on him.

1140
01:27:17,392 --> 01:27:18,552
Okay.

1141
01:27:23,311 --> 01:27:26,271
Marty. Such a nice name.

1142
01:27:31,751 --> 01:27:33,470
Damn! Where is that kid?

1143
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:37,990
Damn!

1144
01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:41,750
Damn! Damn!

1145
01:27:49,269 --> 01:27:51,909
- You're late!
Do you have no concept of time?

1146
01:27:52,109 --> 01:27:54,308
Hey, come on. I had to change.

1147
01:27:54,468 --> 01:27:57,108
Do you think I'm going back
in that zoot suit?

1148
01:27:57,348 --> 01:27:59,748
The old man really came through.
It worked.

1149
01:27:59,988 --> 01:28:01,908
He laid out Biff in one punch.

1150
01:28:02,068 --> 01:28:05,787
I didn't know he had it in him.
He's never stood up to Biff in his life.

1151
01:28:07,547 --> 01:28:10,747
- Never?
- No. Why? What's the matter?

1152
01:28:11,467 --> 01:28:12,667
All right!

1153
01:28:12,987 --> 01:28:14,946
Let's set your destination time.

1154
01:28:19,626 --> 01:28:21,746
- This is the exact time you left.

1155
01:28:22,226 --> 01:28:25,385
Let's send you back at exactly
the same time.

1156
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:30,225
It'll be like you never left.

1157
01:28:32,105 --> 01:28:36,064
Now, I painted a white line
on the street way over there.

1158
01:28:36,424 --> 01:28:38,144
That's where you'll start from.

1159
01:28:38,304 --> 01:28:40,384
I've calculated the precise distance...

1160
01:28:40,544 --> 01:28:43,064
...taking into account
the acceleration speed...

1161
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:47,143
...and wind resistance retroactive
from the moment the lightning strikes...

1162
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:51,863
...which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds.

1163
01:28:52,263 --> 01:28:54,503
When this alarm goes off, you hit the gas.

1164
01:28:54,703 --> 01:28:55,863
Right.

1165
01:29:02,182 --> 01:29:05,142
Well, I guess that's everything.

1166
01:29:09,181 --> 01:29:11,421
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1167
01:29:16,661 --> 01:29:18,460
- See you in about 30 years.

1168
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:21,860
I hope so.

1169
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:24,660
Don't worry!

1170
01:29:25,340 --> 01:29:26,900
As long as you hit that wire...

1171
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:29,899
...with the connecting hook
at precisely 88 miles an hour...

1172
01:29:30,099 --> 01:29:32,819
...the instant the lightning
strikes the tower...

1173
01:29:35,259 --> 01:29:37,299
...everything will be fine.
- Right.

1174
01:29:46,098 --> 01:29:49,498
- What's the meaning of this?
- You'll find out in 30 years.

1175
01:29:49,737 --> 01:29:51,617
It's about the future, isn't it?

1176
01:29:51,817 --> 01:29:54,297
- Information about the future.
- Wait a minute.

1177
01:29:54,497 --> 01:29:56,297
I warned you about this, kid.

1178
01:29:56,457 --> 01:29:59,017
The consequences could be disastrous!

1179
01:29:59,257 --> 01:30:01,456
Doc, that's a risk
you're going to have to take.

1180
01:30:01,616 --> 01:30:04,576
- Your life depends on it!
- No!

1181
01:30:04,776 --> 01:30:07,856
I refuse to accept the responsibility.

1182
01:30:08,296 --> 01:30:10,736
In that case, I'll tell you straight out.

1183
01:30:14,775 --> 01:30:16,055
Great Scott!

1184
01:30:23,734 --> 01:30:26,534
You get the cable,
I'll throw the rope down to you.

1185
01:30:26,734 --> 01:30:28,694
- Right! I got it!

1186
01:31:01,171 --> 01:31:02,371
Doc!

1187
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:13,530
- Come on, come on. Let's go!
- All right! Take it up!

1188
01:31:16,969 --> 01:31:17,969
Go!

1189
01:31:24,808 --> 01:31:25,768
Doc!

1190
01:31:27,008 --> 01:31:30,248
I have to tell you about the future.

1191
01:31:30,448 --> 01:31:34,368
- What?
- I have to tell you about the future!

1192
01:31:34,728 --> 01:31:35,967
What?

1193
01:31:36,087 --> 01:31:40,407
On the night I go back in time you get-

1194
01:31:44,087 --> 01:31:45,287
Doc!

1195
01:31:54,246 --> 01:31:55,086
Go!

1196
01:31:56,086 --> 01:31:58,165
- No, Doc!
- Look at the time!

1197
01:31:58,565 --> 01:32:00,525
You've got less than four minutes.

1198
01:32:00,725 --> 01:32:02,285
Please, hurry!

1199
01:32:13,484 --> 01:32:14,724
- Yeah!

1200
01:33:05,839 --> 01:33:08,839
Damn it, Doc!
Why did you have to tear up that letter?

1201
01:33:09,079 --> 01:33:10,878
If I only had more time.

1202
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:15,998
Wait a minute. I got all the time I want.

1203
01:33:16,158 --> 01:33:19,478
I got a time machine.
I can just go back early and warn him.

1204
01:33:19,718 --> 01:33:21,677
Okay. Ten minutes ought to do it.

1205
01:33:23,637 --> 01:33:25,717
Okay. Time circuit's on.

1206
01:33:26,157 --> 01:33:28,597
Flux capacitor, fluxing.

1207
01:33:29,157 --> 01:33:31,077
Engine running. All right.

1208
01:33:33,876 --> 01:33:36,076
No. No, no.

1209
01:33:36,276 --> 01:33:39,356
Come on. Come on. Not this time.

1210
01:34:46,949 --> 01:34:48,149
- Come on.

1211
01:34:50,229 --> 01:34:52,749
Here we go. Here we go.
This time. Come on.

1212
01:34:54,469 --> 01:34:57,108
Please. Please. Come on!

1213
01:36:31,499 --> 01:36:32,779
Doc.

1214
01:38:05,131 --> 01:38:07,050
Crazy drunk driver.

1215
01:38:21,529 --> 01:38:23,409
All right. Fred.

1216
01:38:25,289 --> 01:38:27,768
You look great. Everything looks great.

1217
01:38:29,208 --> 01:38:30,128
1:24.

1218
01:38:30,288 --> 01:38:32,928
I still got time. I'm coming, Doc!

1219
01:38:36,488 --> 01:38:38,687
No! No, not again!

1220
01:38:38,887 --> 01:38:41,167
Come on! Come on!

1221
01:38:54,326 --> 01:38:55,606
Libyans.

1222
01:39:17,284 --> 01:39:18,244
No!

1223
01:39:19,563 --> 01:39:20,803
Bastards!

1224
01:39:33,802 --> 01:39:35,002
Go!

1225
01:40:08,039 --> 01:40:10,039
- Doc! Doc!

1226
01:40:16,838 --> 01:40:17,678
No!

1227
01:40:31,717 --> 01:40:33,077
You're alive.

1228
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:43,436
Bulletproof vest?

1229
01:40:44,835 --> 01:40:46,635
How did you know?

1230
01:40:47,155 --> 01:40:49,635
I never got a chance to tell you.

1231
01:41:02,554 --> 01:41:06,233
What about all that talk
about screwing up future events?

1232
01:41:06,513 --> 01:41:08,313
The space-time continuum?

1233
01:41:08,913 --> 01:41:11,553
Well, I figured, what the hell.

1234
01:41:21,512 --> 01:41:23,232
- So how far ahead are you going?

1235
01:41:23,392 --> 01:41:26,231
About 30 years. It's a nice round number.

1236
01:41:26,431 --> 01:41:28,391
Look me up when you get there, all right?

1237
01:41:28,591 --> 01:41:30,511
Guess I'll be about 47.

1238
01:41:30,831 --> 01:41:31,831
I will.

1239
01:41:32,391 --> 01:41:33,391
- Take care.

1240
01:41:34,551 --> 01:41:35,511
You, too.

1241
01:41:35,751 --> 01:41:37,870
Right. Bye-bye, Einie.

1242
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:41,070
- And watch that re-entry.
It's a little bumpy.

1243
01:41:41,990 --> 01:41:42,910
You bet.

1244
01:42:45,584 --> 01:42:46,904
What a nightmare.

1245
01:42:57,703 --> 01:43:00,743
- If Paul calls, tell him I'm working
at the boutique late.

1246
01:43:00,943 --> 01:43:02,862
Linda, I'm not your answering service...

1247
01:43:03,022 --> 01:43:06,262
...and somebody named Greg or Craig
called you just a little while ago.

1248
01:43:06,502 --> 01:43:10,222
- Which one was it?
- I can't keep up with your boyfriends.

1249
01:43:12,821 --> 01:43:14,301
- What the hell is this?

1250
01:43:15,141 --> 01:43:16,181
Breakfast.

1251
01:43:16,701 --> 01:43:18,781
- Did you sleep in your clothes again?

1252
01:43:19,141 --> 01:43:20,261
Yeah. I-

1253
01:43:21,421 --> 01:43:23,580
What are you wearing, Dave?

1254
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:25,060
Marty...

1255
01:43:25,620 --> 01:43:27,660
...I always wear a suit to the office.

1256
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:30,020
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1257
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:32,979
- We need a rematch.
- A rematch?

1258
01:43:33,139 --> 01:43:35,139
- Why? Were you cheating?
- No.

1259
01:43:35,299 --> 01:43:36,899
- Hello.
- Good morning.

1260
01:43:39,059 --> 01:43:40,459
Mom! Dad!

1261
01:43:40,899 --> 01:43:43,219
- Hit your head?
- Are you okay?

1262
01:43:43,418 --> 01:43:46,298
You guys look great.
Mom, you look so thin.

1263
01:43:46,698 --> 01:43:48,978
Why, thank you, Marty. George!

1264
01:43:50,538 --> 01:43:52,138
Good morning, sleepyhead.

1265
01:43:53,418 --> 01:43:55,937
- Good morning, kids.
'Morning.

1266
01:43:56,177 --> 01:43:58,497
- Marty, I almost forgot.
Jennifer Parker called.

1267
01:43:58,657 --> 01:44:01,977
I sure like her. She is such a sweet girl.

1268
01:44:02,617 --> 01:44:04,576
Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

1269
01:44:04,736 --> 01:44:06,416
What? What, Ma?

1270
01:44:06,576 --> 01:44:10,256
Aren't you going up to the lake?
You've been planning it for two weeks.

1271
01:44:10,616 --> 01:44:12,936
We talked about this.
How can I go to the lake?

1272
01:44:13,256 --> 01:44:14,296
The car's wrecked.

1273
01:44:14,416 --> 01:44:15,815
- Wrecked?
- Wrecked?

1274
01:44:16,055 --> 01:44:18,055
When did this happen? Why wasn't I told?

1275
01:44:18,215 --> 01:44:21,535
- I'm sure the car is fine.
- Why am I the last to know?

1276
01:44:21,975 --> 01:44:24,615
- See? There's Biff out there
waxing it now.

1277
01:44:25,375 --> 01:44:29,374
Now, Biff, I want to make sure we get
two coats of wax, not just one.

1278
01:44:29,614 --> 01:44:33,414
- I'm just finishing up the second coat now.
- Now, Biff, don't con me.

1279
01:44:35,174 --> 01:44:36,933
I'm sorry, Mr. McFly.

1280
01:44:37,173 --> 01:44:39,813
I meant I was just starting
on the second coat.

1281
01:44:40,613 --> 01:44:42,653
Biff. What a character.

1282
01:44:42,933 --> 01:44:45,133
Always trying to get away with something.

1283
01:44:45,333 --> 01:44:48,092
I've had to stay on top of Biff
ever since high school.

1284
01:44:48,292 --> 01:44:52,012
- But, if it wasn't for him-
- We'd never have fallen in love.

1285
01:44:53,892 --> 01:44:56,252
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly, this just arrived.

1286
01:44:56,492 --> 01:44:58,931
Hi, Marty. I think it's your new book.

1287
01:45:01,731 --> 01:45:03,891
Honey! Your first novel.

1288
01:45:05,451 --> 01:45:10,130
- I've always told you, if you put your
mind to it, you can accomplish anything.

1289
01:45:10,490 --> 01:45:13,810
Marty, here's your keys.
You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

1290
01:45:14,210 --> 01:45:15,090
Keys?

1291
01:45:30,968 --> 01:45:33,208
- How about a ride, mister?
- Jennifer!

1292
01:45:34,928 --> 01:45:36,728
Are you a sight for sore eyes.

1293
01:45:37,128 --> 01:45:38,728
- Let me look at you.

1294
01:45:39,248 --> 01:45:41,887
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

1295
01:45:42,087 --> 01:45:43,127
I haven't.

1296
01:45:44,007 --> 01:45:45,047
You okay?

1297
01:45:45,927 --> 01:45:47,607
Is everything all right?

1298
01:45:50,326 --> 01:45:51,326
- Yeah.

1299
01:45:53,526 --> 01:45:55,046
Everything is great.

1300
01:46:08,925 --> 01:46:09,805
Marty!

1301
01:46:11,164 --> 01:46:13,044
You've got to come back with me!

1302
01:46:13,764 --> 01:46:15,844
- Where?
- Back to the future.

1303
01:46:20,484 --> 01:46:22,163
What are you doing, Doc?

1304
01:46:23,563 --> 01:46:24,683
I need fuel.

1305
01:46:27,883 --> 01:46:29,843
Go ahead. Quick! Get in the car.

1306
01:46:30,243 --> 01:46:34,362
No, no. I just got here. Jennifer's here.
We're taking the new truck for a spin.

1307
01:46:34,642 --> 01:46:37,282
- Bring her along. This concerns her, too.

1308
01:46:37,522 --> 01:46:40,722
What are you talking about?
What happens to us in the future?

1309
01:46:41,162 --> 01:46:43,881
- Do we become assholes or something?
- No, Marty.

1310
01:46:44,081 --> 01:46:47,161
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.
It's your kids, Marty.

1311
01:46:47,361 --> 01:46:49,401
Something has got to be done
about your kids.

1312
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,400
We better back up.
We don't have enough road to get up to 88.

1313
01:46:58,640 --> 01:47:01,960
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.
