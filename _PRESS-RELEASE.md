# Cards Against Sobriety #

## Cards Against Humanity Redux ##
  Play Cards Against Humanity even if your deck or your friends aren't close by.
  All those against sobriety, preferably with something better to drink.

## Summary ##
  Cards against humanity without the humanity. Or apples to apples for grown-ups planning to get tipsy(read: no)/drunk/schwasted/totally blacked. Still no? Then here: the game is simple. Each round, one player asks a question from a Black Card, and everyone else answers with their funniest White Card.

## Problem ##
  So I hear you asking yourself, why not just play cards against humanity? Again, it's simple: you don't have the fucking deck, you don't have any friends, or both. 

## Solution ##
  Hop on Cards Against Sobriety, play with your 'friends' while hanging out with your one true love(read: booze, duh), and have a damn drunk time.
